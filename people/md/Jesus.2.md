#### NT Speeches

earth Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled Blessed are the merciful for they will be shown mercy Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called sons of God Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness for theirs is the kingdom of heaven Blessed are you when people insult you persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you You are the salt of the earth But if the salt loses its savor how can it be made salty again It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men You are the light of the world A city on a hill cannot be hidden Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket Instead they set it on a stand and it gives light to everyone in the house In the same way let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them For I tell you truly until heaven and earth pass away not a single jot not a stroke of a pen will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished So then whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do likewise will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven You have heard that it was said to the ancients Do not murder and Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment Again anyone who says to his brother Raca will be subject to the Sanhedrin But anyone who says You fool will be subject to the fire of hell So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you leave your gift there before the altar First go and be reconciled to your brother then come and offer your gift Reconcile quickly with your adversary while you are still on the way to court Otherwise he may hand you over to the judge and the judge may hand you over to the officer and you may be thrown into prison Truly I tell you you will not get out until you have paid the last penny You have heard that it was said Do not commit adultery But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart If your right eye causes you to sin gouge it out and throw it away It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell And if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to depart into hell It has also been said Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for sexual immorality brings adultery upon her And he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery Again you have heard that it was said to the ancients Do not break your oath but fulfill your vows to the Lord But I tell you not to swear at all either by heaven for it is God’s throne or by the earth for it is His footstool or by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great King Nor should you swear by your head for you cannot make a single hair white or black Simply let your Yes be Yes and your No No Anything more comes from the evil one You have heard that it was said Eye for eye and tooth for tooth But I tell you not to resist an evil person If someone slaps you on right cheek turn to him the other also if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic let him have your cloak as well and if someone forces you to go one mile go with him two miles Give to the one who asks you and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you You have heard that it was said Love your neighbor and Hate your enemy But I tell you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you that you may be sons of your Father in heaven He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous If you love those who love you what reward will you get Do not even tax collectors do the same And if you greet only your brothers what are you doing more than others Do not even Gentiles do the same Be perfect therefore as your heavenly Father is perfect Be careful not to perform your righteous acts before men to be seen by them If you do you will have no reward from your Father in heaven So when you give to the needy do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by men Truly I tell you they already have their full reward But when you give to the needy do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your giving may be in secret And your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you And when you pray do not be like the hypocrites For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men Truly I tell you they already have their full reward But when you pray go into your inner room shut your door and pray to your Father who is unseen And your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you And when you pray do not babble on like pagans for they think that by their many words they will be heard Do not be like them for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him So then this is how you should pray Our Father in heaven hallowed be Your name Your kingdom come Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven Give us this day our daily bread And forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one For if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you But if you do not forgive men neither will your Father forgive yours When you fast do not be somber like the hypocrites for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting Truly I tell you they already have their full reward But when you fast anoint your head and wash your face so that your fasting will not be obvious to men but only to your Father who is unseen And your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal For where your treasure is there your heart will be also The eye is the lamp of the body If your eyes are good your whole body will be full of light But if your eyes are bad your whole body will be full of darkness If then the light within you is darkness how great is that darkness No one can serve two masters Either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other You cannot serve both God and money Therefore I tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or about your body what you will wear Is not life more than food and the body more than clothes Look at the birds of the air They do not sow or reap or gather into barns and yet your heavenly Father feeds them Are you not much more valuable than they Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life And why do you worry about clothes Consider how the lilies of the field grow They do not labor or spin Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these If that is how God clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace will He not much more clothe you O you of little faith Therefore do not worry saying What shall we eat or What shall we drink or What shall we wear For the Gentiles strive after all these things and your heavenly Father knows that you need them But seek first the kingdom and His righteousness and all these things will be added unto you Therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself Today has enough trouble of its own Do not judge or you will be judged For with the same judgment you pronounce you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye but fail to notice the beam in your own eye How can you say to your brother Let me take the speck out of your eye while there is still a beam in your own eye You hypocrite First take the beam out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye Do not give dogs what is holy do not throw your pearls before swine If you do they may trample them under their feet and then turn and tear you to pieces Ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you For everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened Which of you if his son asks for bread will give him a stone Or if he asks for a fish will give him a snake So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him In everything then do to others as you would have them do to you For this is the essence of the Law and the Prophets Enter through the narrow gate For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and many enter through it But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life and only a few find it Beware of false prophets They come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly they are ravenous wolves By their fruit you will recognize them Are grapes gathered from thornbushes or figs from thistles Likewise every good tree bears good fruit but a bad tree bears bad fruit A good tree cannot bear bad fruit and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire Not everyone who says to Me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven Many will say to Me on that day Lord Lord did we not prophesy in Your name and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles Then I will tell them plainly I never knew you depart from Me you workers of lawlessness Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock The rain fell the torrents raged and the winds blew and beat against that house yet it did not fall because its foundation was on the rock But everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand The rain fell the torrents raged and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell and great was its collapse”

* MAT 11:21–24 (rebuking): “Woe to you Chorazin Woe to you Bethsaida For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes But I tell you it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you And you Capernaum will you be lifted up to heaven you will be brought down to Hades For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom it would have remained to this day But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you”

* MAT 12:25–37: “Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste and every city or household divided against itself will not stand If Satan drives out Satan he is divided against himself How then can his kingdom stand And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul by whom do your sons drive them out So then they will be your judges But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God then the kingdom of God has come upon you Or again how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man Then he can plunder his house He who is not with Me is against Me and he who does not gather with Me scatters Therefore I tell you every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the one to come Make a tree good and its fruit will be good or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad for a tree is known by its fruit You brood of vipers how can you who are evil say anything good For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks The good man brings good things out of his good store of treasure and the evil man brings evil things out of his evil store of treasure But I tell you that men will give an account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken For by your words you will be acquitted and by your words you will be condemned”

* MAT 12:39–45 (rebuking): “A wicked and adulterous generation demands a sign but none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and now One greater than Jonah is here The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and now One greater than Solomon is here When an unclean spirit comes out of a man it passes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it Then it says I will return to the house I left On its return it finds the house vacant swept clean and put in order Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself and they go in and dwell there And the final plight of that man is worse than the first So will it be with this wicked generation”

* MAT 13:11–23: “The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you but not to them Whoever has will be given more and he will have an abundance Whoever does not have even what he has will be taken away from him This is why I speak to them in parables Though seeing they do not see though hearing they do not hear or understand In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled You will be ever hearing but never understanding you will be ever seeing but never perceiving For this people’s heart has grown callous they hardly hear with their ears and they have closed their eyes Otherwise they might see with their eyes hear with their ears understand with their hearts and turn and I would heal them But blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear For truly I tell you many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it Consider then the parable of the sower When anyone hears the message of the kingdom but does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart This is the seed sown along the path The seed sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and at once receives it with joy But since he has no root he remains for only a season When trouble or persecution comes because of the word he quickly falls away The seed sown among the thorns is the one who hears the word but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word and it becomes unfruitful But the seed sown on good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it He indeed bears fruit and produces a crop a hundredfold sixtyfold or thirtyfold”

* MAT 13:24–30: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field But while everyone was asleep his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and slipped away When the wheat sprouted and bore grain then the weeds also appeared The owner’s servants came to him and said Sir didn’t you sow good seed in your field Where then did the weeds come from An enemy did this he replied So the servants asked him Do you want us to go and pull them up No he said if you pull the weeds now you might uproot the wheat with them Let both grow together until the harvest At that time I will tell the harvesters First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned then gather the wheat into my barn”

* MAT 24:16–25:46: “then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains Let no one on the housetop come down to retrieve anything from his house And let no one in the field return for his cloak How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers Pray that your flight will not occur in the winter or on the Sabbath For at that time there will be great tribulation unseen from the beginning of the world until now and never to be seen again If those days had not been cut short nobody would be saved But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short At that time if anyone says to you Look here is the Christ or There He is do not believe it For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive even the elect if that were possible See I have told you in advance So if they tell you There He is in the wilderness do not go out He is in the inner rooms do not believe it For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west so will be the coming of the Son of Man Wherever there is a carcass there the vultures will gather Immediately after the tribulation of those days The sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light the stars will fall from the sky and the powers of the heavens will be shaken At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will mourn They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call and they will gather His elect from the four winds from one end of the heavens to the other Now learn this lesson from the fig tree As soon as its branches become tender and sprout leaves you know that summer is near So also when you see all these things you will know that He is near right at the door Truly I tell you this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened Heaven and earth will pass away but My words will never pass away No one knows about that day or hour not even the angels in heaven nor the Son but only the Father As it was in the days of Noah so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man For in the days before the flood people were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark And they were oblivious until the flood came and swept them all away So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man Two men will be in the field one will be taken and the other left Two women will be grinding at the mill one will be taken and the other left Therefore keep watch because you do not know the day on which your Lord will come But understand this If the homeowner had known in which watch of the night the thief was coming he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into For this reason you also must be ready because the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect Who then is the faithful and wise servant whom the master has put in charge of his household to give the others their food at the proper time Blessed is that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns Truly I tell you he will put him in charge of all his possessions But suppose that servant is wicked and says in his heart My master will be away a long time And he begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards The master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not anticipate Then he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom Five of them were foolish and five were wise The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take along any extra oil But the wise ones took oil in flasks along with their lamps When the bridegroom was delayed they all became drowsy and fell asleep At midnight the cry rang out Here is the bridegroom Come out to meet him Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps The foolish ones said to the wise Give us some of your oil our lamps are going out No said the wise ones or there may not be enough for both us and you Instead go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves But while they were on their way to buy it the bridegroom arrived Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet and the door was shut Later the other virgins arrived and said Lord lord open the door for us But he replied Truly I tell you I do not know you Therefore keep watch because you do not know the day or the hour For it is just like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted them with his possessions To one he gave five talents to another two talents and to another one talent each according to his own ability And he went on his journey The servant who had received the five talents went and put them to work and gained five more Likewise the one with the two talents gained two more But the servant who had received the one talent went off dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them The servant who had received the five talents came and presented five more Master he said you entrusted me with five talents See I have gained five more His master replied Well done good and faithful servant You have been faithful with a few things I will put you in charge of many things Enter into the joy of your master The servant who had received the two talents also came and said Master you entrusted me with two talents See I have gained two more His master replied Well done good and faithful servant You have been faithful with a few things I will put you in charge of many things Enter into the joy of your master Finally the servant who had received the one talent came and said Master I knew that you are a hard man reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground See you have what belongs to you You wicked lazy servant replied his master You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed Then you should have deposited my money with the bankers and on my return I would have received it back with interest Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten talents For everyone who has will be given more and he will have an abundance But the one who does not have even what he has will be taken away from him And throw that worthless servant into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth When the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him He will sit on His glorious throne All the nations will be gathered before Him and He will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats He will place the sheep on His right and the goats on His left Then the King will say to those on His right Come you who are blessed by My Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink I was a stranger and you took Me in I was naked and you clothed Me I was sick and you looked after Me I was in prison and you visited Me Then the righteous will answer Him Lord when did we see You hungry and feed You or thirsty and give You something to drink When did we see You a stranger and take You in or naked and clothe You When did we see You sick or in prison and visit You And the King will reply Truly I tell you whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine you did for Me Then He will say to those on His left Depart from Me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink I was a stranger and you did not take Me in I was naked and you did not clothe Me I was sick and in prison and you did not look after Me And they too will reply Lord when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to You Then the King will answer Truly I tell you whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for Me And they will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life”

* JHN 7:16–19: “My teaching is not My own It comes from Him who sent Me If anyone desires to do His will he will know whether My teaching is from God or whether I speak on My own He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is a man of truth in Him there is no falsehood Has not Moses given you the law Yet not one of you keeps it Why are you trying to kill Me”

* JHN 7:21–24: “I did one miracle and you are all amazed But because Moses gave you circumcision you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath not that it is from Moses but from the patriarchs If a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses will not be broken why are you angry with Me for making the whole man well on the Sabbath Stop judging by outward appearances and start judging justly”

* JHN 8:41: “We are not illegitimate children Our only Father is God Himself”

* JHN 8:42–47: “If God were your Father you would love Me for I have come here from God I have not come on My own but He sent Me Why do you not understand what I am saying It is because you are unable to accept My message You belong to your father the devil and you want to carry out his desires He was a murderer from the beginning refusing to uphold the truth because there is no truth in him When he lies he speaks his native language because he is a liar and the father of lies But because I speak the truth you do not believe Me Which of you can prove Me guilty of sin If I speak the truth why do you not believe Me Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God”

* JHN 8:49–51: “I do not have a demon but I honor My Father and you dishonor Me I do not seek My own glory There is One who seeks it and He is the Judge Truly truly I tell you if anyone keeps My word he will never see death”

* JHN 9:41–10:5: “If you were blind you would not be guilty of sin But since you claim you can see your guilt remains Truly truly I tell you whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in some other way is a thief and a robber But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep The gatekeeper opens the gate for him and the sheep listen for his voice He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out When he has brought out all his own he goes on ahead of them and his sheep follow him because they know his voice But they will never follow a stranger in fact they will flee from him because they do not recognize his voice”

* JHN 10:7–18: “Truly truly I tell you I am the gate for the sheep All who came before Me were thieves and robbers but the sheep did not listen to them I am the gate If anyone enters through Me he will be saved He will come in and go out and find pasture The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy I have come that they may have life and have it in all its fullness I am the good shepherd The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep The hired hand is not the shepherd and the sheep are not his own When he sees the wolf coming he abandons the sheep and runs away Then the wolf pounces on them and scatters the flock The man runs away because he is a hired servant and is unconcerned for the sheep I am the good shepherd I know My sheep and My sheep know Me just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father And I lay down My life for the sheep I have other sheep that are not of this fold I must bring them in as well and they will listen to My voice Then there will be one flock and one shepherd The reason the Father loves Me is that I lay down My life in order to take it up again No one takes it from Me but I lay it down of My own accord I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again This charge I have received from My Father”

* JHN 10:25–30: “I already told you but you did not believe The works I do in My Father’s name testify on My behalf But because you are not My sheep you refuse to believe My sheep listen to My voice I know them and they follow Me I give them eternal life and they will never perish No one can snatch them out of My hand My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all No one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand I and the Father are one”

* JHN 10:32: “I have shown you many good works from the Father For which of these do you stone Me”

* JHN 10:34–38: “Is it not written in your Law I have said you are gods If he called them gods to whom the word of God came and the Scripture cannot be broken then what about the One whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world How then can you accuse Me of blasphemy for stating that I am the Son of God If I am not doing the works of My Father then do not believe Me But if I am doing them even though you do not believe Me believe the works themselves so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me and I am in the Father”

* JHN 14:23–16:16: “If anyone loves Me he will keep My word My Father will love him and We will come to him and make Our home with him Whoever does not love Me does not keep My words The word that you hear is not My own but it is from the Father who sent Me All this I have spoken to you while I am still with you But the Advocate the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have told you Peace I leave with you My peace I give to you I do not give to you as the world gives Do not let your hearts be troubled do not be afraid You heard Me say I am going away and I am coming back to you If you loved Me you would rejoice that I am going to the Father because the Father is greater than I And now I have told you before it happens so that when it does happen you will believe I will not speak with you much longer for the prince of this world is coming and he has no claim on Me But I do exactly what the Father has commanded Me so that the world may know that I love the Father Get up Let us go on from here I am the true vine and My Father is the keeper of the vineyard He cuts off every branch in Me that bears no fruit and every branch that does bear fruit He prunes to make it even more fruitful You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you Remain in Me and I will remain in you Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me I am the vine and you are the branches The one who remains in Me and I in him will bear much fruit For apart from Me you can do nothing If anyone does not remain in Me he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers Such branches are gathered up thrown into the fire and burned If you remain in Me and My words remain in you ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you This is to My Father’s glory that you bear much fruit proving yourselves to be My disciples As the Father has loved Me so have I loved you Remain in My love If you keep My commandments you will remain in My love just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and remain in His love I have told you these things so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete This is My commandment that you love one another as I have loved you Greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends You are My friends if you do what I command you No longer do I call you servants for a servant does not understand what his master is doing But I have called you friends because everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you You did not choose Me but I chose you And I appointed you to go and bear fruit fruit that will remain so that whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you This is My command to you Love one another If the world hates you understand that it hated Me first If you were of the world it would love you as its own Instead the world hates you because you are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world Remember the word that I spoke to you No servant is greater than his master If they persecuted Me they will persecute you as well if they kept My word they will keep yours as well But they will treat you like this because of My name since they do not know the One who sent Me If I had not come and spoken to them they would not be guilty of sin Now however they have no excuse for their sin Whoever hates Me hates My Father as well If I had not done among them the works that no one else did they would not be guilty of sin but now they have seen and hated both Me and My Father But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law They hated Me without reason When the Advocate comes whom I will send to you from the Father the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father He will testify about Me And you also must testify because you have been with Me from the beginning I have told you these things so that you will not fall away They will put you out of the synagogues In fact a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God They will do these things because they have not known the Father or Me But I have told you these things so that when their hour comes you will remember that I told you about them I did not tell you these things from the beginning because I was with you Now however I am going to Him who sent Me yet none of you asks Me Where are You going Instead your hearts are filled with sorrow because I have told you these things But I tell you the truth it is for your benefit that I am going away Unless I go away the Advocate will not come to you but if I go I will send Him to you And when He comes He will convict the world in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment in regard to sin because they do not believe in Me in regard to righteousness because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see Me and in regard to judgment because the prince of this world has been condemned I still have much to tell you but you cannot yet bear to hear it However when the Spirit of truth comes He will guide you into all truth For He will not speak on His own but He will speak what He hears and He will declare to you what is to come He will glorify Me by taking from what is Mine and disclosing it to you Everything that belongs to the Father is Mine That is why I said that the Spirit will take from what is Mine and disclose it to you In a little while you will see Me no more and then after a little while you will see Me”

* JHN 16:19–28: “Are you asking one another why I said In a little while you will not see Me and then after a little while you will see Me Truly truly I tell you you will weep and wail while the world rejoices You will grieve but your grief will turn to joy A woman has pain in childbirth because her time has come but when she brings forth her child she forgets her anguish because of her joy that a child has been born into the world So also you have sorrow now but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice and no one will take away your joy In that day you will no longer ask Me anything Truly truly I tell you whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you Until now you have not asked for anything in My name Ask and you will receive so that your joy may be complete I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech An hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you this way but will tell you plainly about the Father In that day you will ask in My name I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf For the Father Himself loves you because you have loved Me and have believed that I came from God I came from the Father and entered the world In turn I will leave the world and go to the Father”

* JHN 16:31–33: “Do you finally believe Look an hour is coming and has already come when you will be scattered each to his own home and you will leave Me all alone Yet I am not alone because the Father is with Me I have told you these things so that in Me you may have peace In the world you will have tribulation But take courage I have overcome the world”

* JHN 17:1–26: “Father the hour has come Glorify Your Son that Your Son may glorify You For You granted Him authority over all people so that He may give eternal life to all those You have given Him Now this is eternal life that they may know You the only true God and Jesus Christ whom You have sent I have glorified You on earth by accomplishing the work You gave Me to do And now Father glorify Me in Your presence with the glory I had with You before the world existed I have revealed Your name to those You have given Me out of the world They were Yours You gave them to Me and they have kept Your word Now they know that everything You have given Me comes from You For I have given them the words You gave Me and they have received them They knew with certainty that I came from You and they believed that You sent Me I ask on their behalf I do not ask on behalf of the world but on behalf of those You have given Me for they are Yours All I have is Yours and all You have is Mine and in them I have been glorified I will no longer be in the world but they are in the world and I am coming to You Holy Father protect them by Your name the name You gave Me so that they may be one as We are one While I was with them I protected and preserved them by Your name the name You gave Me Not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction so that the Scripture would be fulfilled But now I am coming to You and I am saying these things while I am in the world so that they may have My joy fulfilled within them I have given them Your word and the world has hated them For they are not of the world just as I am not of the world I am not asking that You take them out of the world but that You keep them from the evil one They are not of the world just as I am not of the world Sanctify them by the truth Your word is truth As You sent Me into the world I have also sent them into the world For them I sanctify Myself so that they too may be sanctified by the truth I am not asking on behalf of them alone but also on behalf of those who will believe in Me through their message that all of them may be one as You Father are in Me and I am in You May they also be in Us so that the world may believe that You sent Me I have given them the glory You gave Me so that they may be one as We are one I in them and You in Me that they may be perfectly united so that the world may know that You sent Me and have loved them just as You have loved Me Father I want those You have given Me to be with Me where I am that they may see the glory You gave Me because You loved Me before the foundation of the world Righteous Father although the world has not known You I know You and they know that You sent Me And I have made Your name known to them and will continue to make it known so that the love You have for Me may be in them and I in them”
