* DAN 2:15: “Why is the decree from the king so harsh”

* DAN 2:20–23: “Blessed be the name of God forever and ever for wisdom and power belong to Him He changes the times and seasons He removes kings and establishes them He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning He reveals the deep and hidden things He knows what lies in darkness and light dwells with Him To You O God of my fathers I give thanks and praise because You have given me wisdom and power And now You have made known to me what we have requested for You have made known to us the dream of the king”

* DAN 2:24: “Do not execute the wise men of Babylon Bring me before the king and I will give him the interpretation”

* DAN 2:27–45: “No wise man enchanter medium or magician can explain to the king the mystery of which he inquires But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the latter days Your dream and the visions that came into your mind as you lay on your bed were these As you lay on your bed O king your thoughts turned to the future and the Revealer of Mysteries made known to you what will happen And to me this mystery has been revealed not because I have more wisdom than any man alive but in order that the interpretation might be made known to the king and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind As you O king were watching a great statue appeared A great and dazzling statue stood before you and its form was awesome The head of the statue was pure gold its chest and arms were silver its belly and thighs were bronze its legs were iron and its feet were part iron and part clay As you watched a stone was cut out but not by human hands It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and crushed them Then the iron clay bronze silver and gold were shattered and became like chaff on the threshing floor in summer The wind carried them away and not a trace of them could be found But the stone that had struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth This was the dream now we will tell the king its interpretation You O king are the king of kings to whom the God of heaven has given sovereignty power strength and glory Wherever the sons of men or beasts of the field or birds of the air dwell He has given them into your hand and has made you ruler over them all You are that head of gold But after you there will arise another kingdom inferior to yours Next a third kingdom one of bronze will rule the whole earth Finally there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron for iron shatters and crushes all things and like iron that crushes all things it will shatter and crush all the others And just as you saw that the feet and toes were made partly of fired clay and partly of iron so this will be a divided kingdom yet some of the strength of iron will be in it just as you saw the iron mixed with clay And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle As you saw the iron mixed with clay so the peoples will mix with one another but will not hold together any more than iron mixes with clay In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed nor will it be left to another people It will shatter all these kingdoms and bring them to an end but will itself stand forever And just as you saw a stone being cut out of the mountain without human hands and it shattered the iron bronze clay silver and gold so the great God has told the king what will happen in the future The dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy”

* DAN 4:17 (anxious): “The tree you saw that grew large and strong whose top reached the sky and was visible to all the earth”

* DAN 4:18: “whose foliage was beautiful and whose fruit was abundant providing food for all under which the beasts of the field lived and in whose branches the birds of the air nested”

* DAN 4:19: “you O king are that tree For you have become great and strong your greatness has grown to reach the sky and your dominion extends to the ends of the earth”

* DAN 4:20: “And you O king saw a watcher a holy one coming down from heaven and saying Cut down the tree and destroy it but leave the stump with its roots in the ground with a band of iron and bronze around it in the tender grass of the field Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven and graze with the beasts of the field till seven times pass him by”

* DAN 4:21: “This is the interpretation O king and this is the decree that the Most High has issued against my lord the king”

* DAN 4:22: “You will be driven away from mankind and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field You will feed on grass like an ox and be drenched with the dew of heaven and seven times shall pass you by until you acknowledge that the Most High rules over the kingdom of mankind and gives it to whom He wishes”

* DAN 5:17–28: “You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else Nevertheless I will read the inscription for the king and interpret it for him As for you O king the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness glory and honor Because of the greatness that He bestowed on him the people of every nation and language trembled in fear before him He killed whom he wished and kept alive whom he wished he exalted whom he wished and humbled whom he wished But when his heart became arrogant and his spirit was hardened with pride he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was taken from him He was driven away from mankind and his mind was like that of a beast He lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like an ox and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he acknowledged that the Most High God rules over the kingdom of mankind setting over it whom He wishes But you his son O Belshazzar have not humbled your heart even though you knew all this Instead you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven The vessels from His house were brought to you and as you drank wine from them with your nobles wives and concubines you praised your gods of silver and gold bronze and iron wood and stone which cannot see or hear or understand But you have failed to glorify the God who holds in His hand your very breath and all your ways Therefore He sent the hand that wrote the inscription Now this is the inscription that was written MENE MENE TEKEL PARSIN And this is the interpretation of the message MENE means that God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end TEKEL means that you have been weighed on the scales and found deficient PERES means that your kingdom has been divided and given over to the Medes and Persians”

* DAN 6:22–23: “O king may you live forever My God sent His angel and shut the mouths of the lions They have not hurt me for I was found innocent in His sight and I have done no wrong against you O king”

* DAN 7:2–17 (vision): “In my vision in the night I looked and suddenly the four winds of heaven were churning up the great sea Then four great beasts came up out of the sea each one different from the others The first beast was like a lion and it had the wings of an eagle I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man and given the mind of a man Suddenly another beast appeared which looked like a bear It was raised up on one of its sides and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth So it was told Get up and gorge yourself on flesh Next as I watched suddenly another beast appeared It was like a leopard and on its back it had four wings like those of a bird The beast also had four heads and it was given authority to rule After this as I watched in my vision in the night suddenly a fourth beast appeared and it was terrifying dreadful and extremely strong with large iron teeth It devoured and crushed then it trampled underfoot whatever was left It was different from all the beasts before it and it had ten horns While I was contemplating the horns suddenly another horn a little one came up among them and three of the first horns were uprooted before it This horn had eyes like those of a man and a mouth that spoke words of arrogance As I continued to watch thrones were set in place and the Ancient of Days took His seat His clothing was white as snow and the hair of His head was like pure wool His throne was flaming with fire and its wheels were all ablaze A river of fire was flowing coming out from His presence Thousands upon thousands attended Him and myriads upon myriads stood before Him The court was convened and the books were opened Then I kept watching because of the arrogant words the horn was speaking As I continued to watch the beast was slain and its body was destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire As for the rest of the beasts their dominion was removed but they were granted an extension of life for a season and a time In my vision in the night I continued to watch and I saw One like the Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into His presence And He was given dominion glory and kingship that the people of every nation and language should serve Him His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away and His kingdom is one that will never be destroyed I Daniel was grieved in my spirit and the visions in my mind alarmed me I approached one of those who were standing there and I asked him the true meaning of all this So he told me the interpretation of these things These four great beasts are four kings who will arise from the earth”

* DAN 7:18 (vision): “But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever and ever”

* DAN 7:19–23 (vision): “Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast which was different from all the others extremely terrifying devouring and crushing with iron teeth and bronze claws then trampling underfoot whatever was left I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and the other horn that came up before which three of them fell the horn whose appearance was more imposing than the others with eyes and with a mouth that spoke words of arrogance As I watched this horn was waging war against the saints and prevailing against them until the Ancient of Days arrived and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High and the time came for them to possess the kingdom This is what he said The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on the earth different from all the other kingdoms and it will devour the whole earth trample it down and crush it”
