* EST 7:3–4: “I have found favor in your sight O king and if it pleases the king grant me my life as my petition and the lives of my people as my request For my people and I have been sold out to destruction death and annihilation If we had merely been sold as menservants and maidservants I would have remained silent because no such distress would justify burdening the king”
