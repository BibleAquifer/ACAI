* 1KI 8:23–53 (praying): “O LORD God of Israel there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth below keeping Your covenant of loving devotion with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts You have kept Your promise to Your servant my father David What You spoke with Your mouth You have fulfilled with Your hand this day Therefore now O LORD God of Israel keep for Your servant my father David what You promised when You said You will never fail to have a man to sit before Me on the throne of Israel if only your descendants guard their way to walk before Me as you have done And now O God of Israel please confirm what You promised to Your servant my father David But will God indeed dwell upon the earth The heavens even the highest heavens cannot contain You much less this temple I have built Yet regard the prayer and plea of Your servant O LORD my God so that You may hear the cry and the prayer that Your servant is praying before You today May Your eyes be open toward this temple night and day toward the place of which You said My Name shall be there so that You may hear the prayer that Your servant prays toward this place Hear the plea of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place May You hear from heaven Your dwelling place May You hear and forgive When a man sins against his neighbor and is required to take an oath and he comes

confess Your name praying and pleading with You in this temple then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel May You restore them to the land You gave to their fathers When the skies are shut and there is no rain because Your people have sinned against You and they pray toward this place and confess Your name and they turn from their sins because You have afflicted them

people as an inheritance When famine or plague comes upon the land or blight or mildew or locusts or grasshoppers or when their enemy besieges them in their cities whatever plague or sickness may come then may whatever prayer or petition Your people Israel make each knowing his own afflictions and spreading out his hands toward this temple be heard by You from heaven Your dwelling place And may You forgive and act and repay each man according to all his ways since You know his heart for You alone know the hearts of all men so that they may fear You all the days they live in the land that You gave to our fathers And as for the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of Your name for they will hear of Your great name and mighty hand and

earth will know Your name and fear You as do Your people Israel and they will know that this house I have built is called by Your Name When Your people go to war against their enemies wherever You send them and when they pray to the LORD in the direction of the city You have chosen and the house I have built for Your Name then may You hear from heaven their prayer and their plea and may You uphold their cause When they sin against You for there is no one who does not sin and You become angry with them and deliver them to an enemy who takes them as captives to his own land whether far or near and when they come to their senses in the land to which they were taken and they repent and plead with You in the land of their captors saying We have sinned and done wrong we have acted wickedly and when they return to You with all their heart and soul in the land of the enemies who took them captive and when they pray to You in the direction of the land that You gave to their fathers the city You have chosen and the house I have built for Your Name then may You hear from heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and petition and may You uphold their cause May You forgive Your people who have sinned against You and all the transgressions they have committed against You and may You grant them compassion in the eyes of their captors to show them mercy For they are Your people and Your inheritance You brought them out of Egypt out of the furnace for iron May Your eyes be open to the pleas of Your servant and of Your people Israel and may You listen to them whenever they call to You
