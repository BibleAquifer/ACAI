#### OT Speeches

* JOB 8:2–22: “How long will you go on saying such things The words of your mouth are a blustering wind Does God pervert justice Does the Almighty pervert what is right When your children sinned against Him He gave them over to their rebellion But if you would earnestly seek God and ask the Almighty for mercy if you are pure and upright even now He will rouse Himself on your behalf and restore your righteous estate Though your beginnings were modest your latter days will flourish Please inquire of past generations and consider the discoveries of their fathers For we were born yesterday and know nothing our days on earth are but a shadow Will they not teach you and tell you and speak from their understanding Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh Do reeds flourish without water While the shoots are still uncut they dry up more quickly than grass Such is the destiny of all who forget God so the hope of the godless will perish His confidence is fragile his security is in a spider’s web He leans on his web but it gives way he holds fast but it does not endure He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine spreading its shoots over the garden His roots wrap around the rock heap he looks for a home among the stones If he is uprooted from his place it will disown him saying I never saw you Surely this is the joy of his way yet others will spring from the dust Behold God does not reject the blameless nor will He strengthen the hand of evildoers He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with a shout of joy Your enemies will be clothed in shame and the tent of the wicked will be no more”

* JOB 18:2–21: “How long until you end these speeches Show some sense and then we can talk Why are we regarded as cattle as stupid in your sight You who tear yourself in anger should the earth be forsaken on your account or the rocks be moved from their place Indeed the lamp of the wicked is extinguished the flame of his fire does not glow The light in his tent grows dark and the lamp beside him goes out His vigorous stride is shortened and his own schemes trip him up For his own feet lead him into a net and he wanders into its mesh A trap seizes his heel a snare grips him A noose is hidden in the ground and a trap lies in his path Terrors frighten him on every side and harass his every step His strength is depleted and calamity is ready at his side It devours patches of his skin the firstborn of death devours his limbs He is torn from the shelter of his tent and is marched off to the king of terrors Fire resides in his tent burning sulfur rains down on his dwelling The roots beneath him dry up and the branches above him wither away The memory of him perishes from the earth and he has no name in the land He is driven from light into darkness and is chased from the inhabited world He has no offspring or posterity among his people no survivor where he once lived Those in the west are appalled at his fate while those in the east tremble in horror Surely such is the dwelling of the wicked and the place of one who does not know God”

* JOB 25:2–6: “Dominion and awe belong to God He establishes harmony in the heights of heaven Can His troops be numbered On whom does His light not rise How then can a man be just before God How can one born of woman be pure If even the moon does not shine and the stars are not pure in His sight how much less man who is but a maggot and the son of man who is but a worm”
