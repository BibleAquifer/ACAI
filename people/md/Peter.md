* ACT 5:3–4 (rebuking): “Ananias how is it that Satan has filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and withhold some of the proceeds from the land Did it not belong to you before it was sold And after it was sold was it not at your disposal How could you conceive such a deed in your heart You have not lied to men but to God”

* ACT 8:20–23 (rebuking): “May your silver perish with you because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money You have no part or share in our ministry because your heart is not right before God Repent therefore of your wickedness and pray to the Lord Perhaps He will forgive you for the intent of your heart For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and captive to iniquity”
