* ACT 13:16–38 (preaching): “Men of Israel and you Gentiles who fear God listen to me The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers He made them into a great people during their stay in Egypt and with an uplifted arm He led them out of that land He endured their conduct for about forty years in the wilderness And having vanquished seven nations in Canaan He gave their land to His people as an inheritance All this took about 450 years After this God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet Then the people asked for a king and God gave them Saul son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin who ruled forty years After removing Saul He raised up David as their king and testified about him I have found David son of Jesse a man after My own heart he will carry out My will in its entirety From the descendants of this man God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus as He promised Before the arrival of Jesus John preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel As John was completing his course he said Who do you suppose I am I am not that One But there is One coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie Brothers children of Abraham and you Gentiles who fear God it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus yet in condemning Him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath And though they found no ground for a death sentence they asked Pilate to have Him executed When they had carried out all that was written about Him they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb But God raised Him from the dead and for many days He was seen by those who had accompanied Him from Galilee to Jerusalem They are now His witnesses to our people And now we proclaim to you the good news What God promised our fathers He has fulfilled for us children by raising up Jesus As it is written in the second Psalm You are My Son today I have become Your Father In fact God raised Him from the dead never to see decay As He has said I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David So also He says in another Psalm You will not let Your Holy One see decay For when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation he fell asleep His body was buried with his fathers and saw decay But the One whom God raised from the dead did not see decay Therefore let it be known to you brothers that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you”

* ACT 13:40–41 (preaching): “Watch out then that what was spoken by the prophets does not happen to you Look you scoffers wonder and perish For I am doing a work in your days that you would never believe even if someone told you”

* ACT 13:46–47 (boldly): “It was necessary to speak the word of God to you first But since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life we now turn to the Gentiles For this is what the Lord has commanded us I have made you a light for the Gentiles to bring salvation to the ends of the earth”

* ACT 14:10 (calling out): “Stand up on your feet”

* ACT 14:15–17 (preaching): “Men why are you doing this We too are only men human like you We are bringing you good news that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God who made heaven and earth and sea and everything in them In past generations He let all nations go their own way Yet He has not left Himself without testimony to His goodness He gives you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling your hearts with food and gladness”

* ACT 17:22–31: “Men of Athens I see that in every way you are very religious For as I walked around and examined your objects of worship I even found an altar with this inscription TO AN UNKNOWN GOD Therefore what you worship as something unknown I now proclaim to you The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples made by human hands Nor is He served by human hands as if He needed anything because He Himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else From one man He made every nation of men that they should inhabit the whole earth and He determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their lands God intended that they would seek Him and perhaps reach out for Him and find Him though He is not far from each one of us For in Him we live and move and have our being As some of your own poets have said We are His offspring Therefore being offspring of God we should not think that the Divine Being is like gold or silver or stone an image formed by man’s skill and imagination Although God overlooked the ignorance of earlier times He now commands all people everywhere to repent For He has set a day when He will judge the world with justice by the Man He has appointed He has given proof of this to everyone by raising Him from the dead”

* ACT 26:2–23: “King Agrippa I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today to defend myself against all the accusations of the Jews especially since you are acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies I beg you therefore to listen to me patiently Surely all Jews know how I have lived from my earliest childhood among my own people and also in Jerusalem They have known me for a long time and can testify if they are willing that I lived as a Pharisee adhering to the strictest sect of our religion And now I stand on trial because of my hope in the promise that God made to our fathers the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night It is because of this hope O king that I am accused by the Jews Why would any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead So then I too was convinced that I ought to do all I could to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth And that is what I did in Jerusalem With authority from the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison and when they were condemned to death I cast my vote against them I frequently had them punished in the synagogues and I tried to make them blaspheme In my raging fury against them I even went to foreign cities to persecute them In this pursuit I was on my way to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests About noon O king as I was on the road I saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun shining around me and my companions We all fell to the ground and I heard a voice say to me in Hebrew Saul Saul why do you persecute Me It is hard for you to kick against the goads Who are You Lord I asked I am Jesus whom you are persecuting the Lord replied But get up and stand on your feet For I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen from Me and what I will show you I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles I am sending you to them to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those sanctified by faith in Me So then King Agrippa I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision First to those in Damascus and Jerusalem then to everyone in the region of Judea and then to the Gentiles I declared that they should repent and turn to God performing deeds worthy of their repentance For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me But I have had God’s help to this day and I stand here to testify to small and great alike I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen that the Christ would suffer and as the first to rise from the dead would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles”

* ACT 26:25–27: “answered I am not insane most excellent Festus I am speaking words of truth and sobriety For the king knows about these matters and I can speak freely to him I am confident that none of this has escaped his notice because it was not done in a corner King Agrippa do you believe the prophets I know you do”

* ACT 28:17–20: “Brothers although I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers I was taken prisoner in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans They examined me and wanted to release me because there was no basis for a death sentence against me But when the Jews objected I was compelled to appeal to Caesar even though I have no charge to bring against my nation So for this reason I have called to see you and speak with you It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain”

* ACT 28:25: “The Holy Spirit was right when He spoke to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet”

* ACT 28:27–28: “For this people’s heart has grown callous they hardly hear with their ears and they have closed their eyes Otherwise they might see with their eyes hear with their ears understand with their hearts and turn and I would heal them Be advised therefore that God’s salvation has been sent to the Gentiles and they will listen”
