* DEU 6:1–20: “These are the commandments and statutes and ordinances that the LORD your God has instructed me to teach you to follow in the land that you are about to enter and possess so that you and your children and grandchildren may fear the LORD your God all the days of your lives by keeping all His statutes and commandments that I give you and so that your days may be prolonged Hear O Israel and be careful to observe them so that you may prosper and multiply greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey just as the LORD the God of your fathers has promised you Hear O Israel The LORD our God the LORD is One And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength These words I am commanding you today are to be upon your hearts And you shall teach them diligently to your children and speak of them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road when you lie down and when you get up Tie them as reminders on your hands and bind them on your foreheads Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates And when the LORD your God brings you into the land He swore to your fathers to Abraham Isaac and Jacob that He would give you a land with great and splendid cities that you did not build with houses full of every good thing with which you did not fill them with wells that you did not dig and with vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant and when you eat and are satisfied be careful not to forget the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt out of the house of slavery Fear the LORD your God serve Him only and take your oaths in His name Do not follow other gods the gods of the peoples around you For the LORD your God who is among you is a jealous God Otherwise the anger of the LORD your God will be kindled against you and He will wipe you off the face of the earth Do not test the LORD your God as you tested Him at Massah You are to diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God and the testimonies and statutes He has given you Do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD so that it may be well with you and that you may enter and possess the good land that the LORD your God swore to give your fathers driving out all your enemies before you as the LORD has said In the future when your son asks What is the meaning of the decrees and statutes and ordinances that the LORD our God has commanded you”

* DEU 6:21: “then you are to tell him We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand”

* DEU 6:22: “Before our eyes the LORD inflicted great and devastating signs and wonders on Egypt on Pharaoh and on all his household”

* DEU 6:23: “But He brought us out from there to lead us in and give us the land that He had sworn to our fathers”

* DEU 6:24: “And the LORD commanded us to observe all these statutes and to fear the LORD our God that we may always be prosperous and preserved as we are to this day”

* DEU 6:25: “And if we are careful to observe every one of these commandments before the LORD our God as He has commanded us then that will be our righteousness”

* DEU 7:1–17: “When the LORD your God brings you into the land that you are entering to possess and He drives out before you many nations the Hittites Girgashites Amorites Canaanites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites seven nations larger and stronger than you and when the LORD your God has delivered them over to you to defeat them then you must devote them to complete destruction Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy Do not intermarry with them Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons because they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods Then the anger of the LORD will burn against you and He will swiftly destroy you Instead this is what you are to do to them tear down their altars smash their sacred pillars cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols in the fire For you are a people holy to the LORD your God The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for His prized possession out of all peoples on the face of the earth The LORD did not set His affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than the other peoples for you were the fewest of all peoples But because the LORD loved you and kept the oath He swore to your fathers He brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt Know therefore that the LORD your God is God the faithful God who keeps His covenant of loving devotion for a thousand generations of those who love Him and keep His commandments But those who hate Him He repays to their faces with destruction He will not hesitate to repay to his face the one who hates Him So keep the commandments and statutes and ordinances that I am giving you to follow this day If you listen to these ordinances and keep them carefully then the LORD your God will keep His covenant and the loving devotion that He swore to your fathers He will love you and bless you and multiply you He will bless the fruit of your womb and the produce of your land your grain new wine and oil the young of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land that He swore to your fathers to give you You will be blessed above all peoples among you there will be no barren man or woman or livestock And the LORD will remove from you all sickness He will not lay upon you any of the terrible diseases you knew in Egypt but He will inflict them on all who hate you You must destroy all the peoples the LORD your God will deliver to you Do not look on them with pity Do not worship their gods for that will be a snare to you You may say in your heart These nations are greater than we are how can we drive them out”

* DEU 7:18–8:17: “But do not be afraid of them Be sure to remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt the great trials that you saw the signs and wonders and the mighty hand and outstretched arm by which the LORD your God brought you out The LORD your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear Moreover the LORD your God will send the hornet against them until even the survivors hiding from you have perished Do not be terrified by them for the LORD your God who is among you is a great and awesome God The LORD your God will drive out these nations before you little by little You will not be enabled to eliminate them all at once or the wild animals would multiply around you But the LORD your God will give them over to you and throw them into great confusion until they are destroyed He will hand their kings over to you and you will wipe out their names from under heaven No one will be able to stand against you you will annihilate them You must burn up the images of their gods do not covet the silver and gold that is on them or take it for yourselves or you will be ensnared by it for it is detestable to the LORD your God And you must not bring any detestable thing into your house or you like it will be set apart for destruction You are to utterly detest and abhor it because it is set apart for destruction You must carefully follow every commandment I am giving you today so that you may live and multiply and enter and possess the land that the LORD swore to give your fathers Remember that these forty years the LORD your God led you all the way in the wilderness so that He might humble you and test you in order to know what was in your heart whether or not you would keep His commandments He humbled you and in your hunger He gave you manna to eat which neither you nor your fathers had known so that you might understand that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD Your clothing did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years So know in your heart that just as a man disciplines his son so the LORD your God disciplines you Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God walking in His ways and fearing Him For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land a land of brooks and fountains and springs that flow through the valleys and hills a land of wheat barley vines fig trees and pomegranates a land of olive oil and honey a land where you will eat food without scarcity where you will lack nothing a land whose rocks are iron and whose hills are ready to be mined for copper When you eat and are satisfied you are to bless the LORD your God for the good land that He has given you Be careful not to forget the LORD your God by failing to keep His commandments and ordinances and statutes which I am giving you this day Otherwise when you eat and are satisfied when you build fine houses in which to dwell and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all that you have is multiplied then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt out of the house of slavery He led you through the vast and terrifying wilderness with its venomous snakes and scorpions a thirsty and waterless land He brought you water from the rock of flint He fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers had not known in order to humble you and test you so that in the end He might cause you to prosper You might say in your heart The power and strength of my hands have made this wealth for me”

* DEU 8:18–9:2: “But remember that it is the LORD your God who gives you the power to gain wealth in order to confirm His covenant that He swore to your fathers even to this day If you ever forget the LORD your God and go after other gods to worship and bow down to them I testify against you today that you will surely perish Like the nations that the LORD has destroyed before you so you will perish if you do not obey the LORD your God Hear O Israel Today you are about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you with large cities fortified to the heavens The people are strong and tall the descendants of the Anakim You know about them and you have heard it said Who can stand up to the sons of Anak”

* DEU 9:3–4: “But understand that today the LORD your God goes across ahead of you as a consuming fire He will destroy them and subdue them before you And you will drive them out and annihilate them swiftly as the LORD has promised you When the LORD your God has driven them out before you do not say in your heart Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land the LORD is driving out these nations before you because of their wickedness”

* DEU 9:5–12: “It is not because of your righteousness or uprightness of heart that you are going in to possess their land but it is because of their wickedness that the LORD your God is driving out these nations before you to keep the promise He swore to your fathers to Abraham Isaac and Jacob Understand then that it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess for you are a stiff-necked people Remember this and never forget how you provoked the LORD your God in the wilderness From the day you left the land of Egypt until you reached this place you have been rebelling against the LORD At Horeb you provoked the LORD and He was angry enough to destroy you When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights I ate no bread and drank no water Then the LORD gave me the two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God with the exact words that the LORD spoke to you out of the fire on the mountain on the day of the assembly And at the end of forty days and forty nights the LORD gave me the two stone tablets the tablets of the covenant And the LORD said to me Get up and go down from here at once for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves How quickly they have turned aside from the way that I commanded them They have made for themselves a molten image”

* DEU 9:13: “The LORD also said to me I have seen this people and they are indeed a stiff-necked people”

* DEU 9:14: “Leave Me alone so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven Then I will make you into a nation mightier and greater than they are”

* DEU 9:15–23: “So I went back down the mountain while it was blazing with fire with the two tablets of the covenant in my hands And I saw how you had sinned against the LORD your God you had made for yourselves a molten calf You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands shattering them before your eyes Then I fell down before the LORD for forty days and forty nights as I had done the first time I did not eat bread or drink water because of all the sin you had committed in doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD and provoking Him to anger For I was afraid of the anger and wrath that the LORD had directed against you enough to destroy you But the LORD listened to me this time as well The LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him but at that time I also prayed for Aaron And I took that sinful thing the calf you had made and burned it in the fire Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and I cast it into the stream that came down from the mountain You continued to provoke the LORD at Taberah at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah And when the LORD sent you out from Kadesh-barnea He said Go up and possess the land that I have given you But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God You neither believed Him nor obeyed Him”

* DEU 9:24–10:5: “You have been rebelling against the LORD since the day I came to know you So I fell down before the LORD for forty days and forty nights because the LORD had said He would destroy you And I prayed to the LORD and said O Lord GOD do not destroy Your people Your inheritance whom You redeemed through Your greatness and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand Remember Your servants Abraham Isaac and Jacob Overlook the stubbornness of this people and the wickedness of their sin Otherwise those in the land from which You brought us out will say Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land He had promised them and because He hated them He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness But they are Your people Your inheritance whom You brought out by Your great power and outstretched arm At that time the LORD said to me Chisel out two stone tablets like the originals come up to Me on the mountain and make an ark of wood And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke and you are to place them in the ark So I made an ark of acacia wood chiseled out two stone tablets like the originals and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands And the LORD wrote on the tablets what had been written previously the Ten Commandments that He had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly The LORD gave them to me and I went back down the mountain and placed the tablets in the ark I had made as the LORD had commanded me and there they have remained”

* DEU 10:10–11: “I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights like the first time and that time the LORD again listened to me and agreed not to destroy you Then the LORD said to me Get up Continue your journey ahead of the people that they may enter and possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give them”

* DEU 10:12–11:14: “And now O Israel what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God by walking in all His ways to love Him to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD that I am giving you this day for your own good Behold to the LORD your God belong the heavens even the highest heavens and the earth and everything in it Yet the LORD has set His affection on your fathers and loved them And He has chosen you their descendants after them above all the peoples even to this day Circumcise your hearts therefore and stiffen your necks no more For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords the great mighty and awesome God showing no partiality and accepting no bribe He executes justice for the fatherless and widow and He loves the foreigner giving him food and clothing So you also must love the foreigner since you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt You are to fear the LORD your God and serve Him Hold fast to Him and take your oaths in His name He is your praise and He is your God who has done for you these great and awesome wonders that your eyes have seen Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy in all and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky You shall therefore love the LORD your God and always keep His charge His statutes His ordinances and His commandments Know this day that it is not your children who have known and seen the discipline of the LORD your God His greatness His mighty hand and His outstretched arm the signs and works He did in Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and all his land what He did to the Egyptian army and horses and chariots when He made the waters of the Red Sea engulf them as they pursued you and how He destroyed them completely even to this day what He did for you in the wilderness until you reached this place and what He did in the midst of all the Israelites to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab the Reubenite when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them their households their tents and every living thing that belonged to them For it is your own eyes that have seen every great work that the LORD has done You shall therefore keep every commandment I am giving you today so that you may have the strength to go in and possess the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess and so that you may live long in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give them and their descendants a land flowing with milk and honey For the land that you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come where you sowed your seed and irrigated on foot like a vegetable garden But the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks in the rain from heaven It is a land for which the LORD your God cares the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it from the beginning to the end of the year So if you carefully obey the commandments I am giving you today to love the LORD your God and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul then I will provide rain for your land in season the autumn and spring rains that you may gather your grain”

* DEU 11:14: “new wine”

* DEU 11:14: “and oil”

* DEU 11:15: “And I will provide grass in the fields for your livestock”

* DEU 11:15–12:20: “and you will eat and be satisfied But be careful that you are not enticed to turn aside to worship and bow down to other gods or the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you He will shut the heavens so that there will be no rain nor will the land yield its produce and you will soon perish from the good land that the LORD is giving you Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds tie them as reminders on your hands and bind them on your foreheads Teach them to your children speaking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road when you lie down and when you get up Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates so that as long as the heavens are above the earth your days and those of your children may be multiplied in the land that the LORD swore to give your fathers For if you carefully keep all these commandments I am giving you to follow to love the LORD your God to walk in all His ways and to hold fast to Him then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you and you will dispossess nations greater and stronger than you Every place where the sole of your foot treads will be yours Your territory will extend from the wilderness to Lebanon and from the Euphrates River to the Western Sea No man will be able to stand against you the LORD your God will put the fear and dread of you upon all the land wherever you set foot as He has promised you See today I am setting before you a blessing and a curse a blessing if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I am giving you today but a curse if you disobey the commandments of the LORD your God and turn aside from the path I command you today by following other gods which you have not known When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess you are to proclaim the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal Are not these mountains across the Jordan west of the road toward the sunset in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah opposite Gilgal near the Oak of Moreh For you are about to cross the Jordan to enter and possess the land that the LORD your God is giving you When you take possession of it and settle in it be careful to follow all the statutes and ordinances that I am setting before you today These are the statutes and ordinances you must be careful to follow all the days you live in the land that the LORD the God of your fathers has given you to possess Destroy completely all the places where the nations you are dispossessing have served their gods atop the high mountains on the hills and under every green tree Tear down their altars smash their sacred pillars burn up their Asherah poles cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from every place You shall not worship the LORD your God in this way Instead you must seek the place the LORD your God will choose from among all your tribes to establish as a dwelling for His Name and there you must go To that place you are to bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices your tithes and heave offerings your vow offerings and freewill offerings as well as the firstborn of your herds and flocks There in the presence of the LORD your God you and your households shall eat and rejoice in all you do because the LORD your God has blessed you You are not to do as we are doing here today where everyone does what seems right in his own eyes For you have not yet come to the resting place and the inheritance that the LORD your God is giving you When you cross the Jordan and live in the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance and He gives you rest from all the enemies around you and you dwell securely then the LORD your God will choose a dwelling for His Name And there you are to bring everything I command you your burnt offerings and sacrifices your tithes and special gifts and all the choice offerings you vow to the LORD And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God you your sons and daughters your menservants and maidservants and the Levite within your gates since he has no portion or inheritance among you Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings in just any place you see you must offer them only in the place the LORD will choose in one of your tribal territories and there you shall do all that I command you But whenever you want you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your gates according to the blessing the LORD your God has given you Both the ceremonially clean and unclean may eat it as they would a gazelle or deer but you must not eat the blood pour it on the ground like water Within your gates you must not eat the tithe of your grain or new wine or oil the firstborn of your herds or flocks any of the offerings that you have vowed to give or your freewill offerings or special gifts Instead you must eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place the LORD your God will choose you your sons and daughters your menservants and maidservants and the Levite within your gates Rejoice before the LORD your God in all you do and be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land When the LORD your God expands your territory as He has promised and you crave meat and say I want to eat meat you may eat it whenever you want”

* DEU 12:21–30: “If the place where the LORD your God chooses to put His Name is too far from you then you may slaughter any of the herd or flock He has given you as I have commanded you and you may eat it within your gates whenever you want Indeed you may eat it as you would eat a gazelle or deer both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it Only be sure not to eat the blood because the blood is the life and you must not eat the life with the meat You must not eat the blood pour it on the ground like water Do not eat it so that it may go well with you and your children after you because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD But you are to take your holy things and your vow offerings and go to the place the LORD will choose Present the meat and blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD your God The blood of your other sacrifices must be poured out beside the altar of the LORD your God but you may eat the meat Be careful to obey all these things I command you so that it may always go well with you and your children after you because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the LORD your God When the LORD your God cuts off before you the nations you are entering to dispossess and you drive them out and live in their land be careful not to be ensnared by their ways after they have been destroyed before you Do not inquire about their gods asking How do these nations serve their gods I will do likewise”

* DEU 12:31–13:3: “You must not worship the LORD your God in this way because they practice for their gods every abomination which the LORD hates They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods See that you do everything I command you do not add to it or subtract from it If a prophet or dreamer of dreams arises among you and proclaims a sign or wonder to you and if the sign or wonder he has spoken to you comes about but he says Let us follow other gods which”

* DEU 13:3: “let us worship them”

* DEU 13:4–7: “you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer For the LORD your God is testing you to find out whether you love Him with all your heart and with all your soul You are to follow the LORD your God and fear Him Keep His commandments and listen to His voice serve Him and hold fast to Him Such a prophet or dreamer must be put to death because he has advocated rebellion against the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery he has tried to turn you from the way in which the LORD your God has commanded you to walk So you must purge the evil from among you If your very own brother or your son or daughter or the wife you embrace or your closest friend secretly entices you saying Let us go and worship other gods which neither you nor your fathers have known”

* DEU 13:8–14: “the gods of the peoples around you whether near or far whether from one end of the earth or the other you must not yield to him or listen to him Show him no pity and do not spare him or shield him Instead you must surely kill him Your hand must be the first against him to put him to death and then the hands of all the people Stone him to death for trying to turn you away from the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt out of the house of slavery Then all Israel will hear and be afraid and will never again do such a wicked thing among you If regarding one of the cities the LORD your God is giving you to inhabit you hear it said that wicked men have arisen from among you and have led the people of their city astray saying Let us go and serve other gods which you have not”

* DEU 13:15–15:9: “then you must inquire investigate and interrogate thoroughly And if it is established with certainty that this abomination has been committed among you you must surely put the inhabitants of that city to the sword Devote to destruction all its people and livestock And you are to gather all its plunder in the middle of the public square and completely burn the city and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God The city must remain a mound of ruins forever never to be rebuilt Nothing devoted to destruction shall cling to your hands so that the LORD will turn from His fierce anger grant you mercy show you compassion and multiply you as He swore to your fathers because you obey the LORD your God keeping all His commandments I am giving you today and doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD your God You are sons of the LORD your God do not cut yourselves or shave your foreheads on behalf of the dead for you are a people holy to the LORD your God The LORD has chosen you to be a people for His prized possession out of all the peoples on the face of the earth You must not eat any detestable thing These are the animals that you may eat The ox the sheep the goat the deer the gazelle the roe deer the wild goat the ibex the antelope and the mountain sheep You may eat any animal that has a split hoof divided in two and that chews the cud But of those that chew the cud or have a completely divided hoof you are not to eat the following the camel the rabbit or the rock badger Although they chew the cud they do not have a divided hoof They are unclean for you as well as the pig though it has a divided hoof it does not chew the cud It is unclean for you You must not eat its meat or touch its carcass Of all the creatures that live in the water you may eat anything with fins and scales but you may not eat anything that does not have fins and scales it is unclean for you You may eat any clean bird but these you may not eat the eagle the bearded vulture the black vulture the red kite the falcon any kind of kite any kind of raven the ostrich the screech owl the gull any kind of hawk the little owl the great owl the white owl the desert owl the osprey the cormorant the stork any kind of heron the hoopoe or the bat All flying insects are unclean for you they may not be eaten But you may eat any clean bird You are not to eat any carcass you may give it to the foreigner residing within your gates and he may eat it or you may sell it to a foreigner For you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk You must be sure to set aside a tenth of all the produce brought forth each year from your fields And you are to eat a tenth of your grain new wine and oil and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the presence of the LORD your God at the place He will choose as a dwelling for His Name so that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always But if the distance is too great for you to carry that with which the LORD your God has blessed you because the place where the LORD your God will choose to put His Name is too far away then exchange it for money take the money in your hand and go to the place the LORD your God will choose Then you may spend the money on anything you desire cattle sheep wine strong drink or anything you wish You are to feast there in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice with your household And do not neglect the Levite within your gates since he has no portion or inheritance among you At the end of every three years bring a tenth of all your produce for that year and lay it up within your gates Then the Levite because he has no portion or inheritance among you the foreigner the fatherless and the widow within your gates may come and eat and be satisfied And the LORD your God will bless you in all the work of your hands At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts This is the manner of remission Every creditor shall cancel what he has loaned to his neighbor He is not to collect anything from his neighbor or brother because the LORD’s time of release has been proclaimed You may collect something from a foreigner but you must forgive whatever your brother owes you There will be no poor among you however because the LORD will surely bless you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance if only you obey the LORD your God and are careful to follow all these commandments I am giving you today When the LORD your God blesses you as He has promised you will lend to many nations but borrow from none you will rule over many nations but be ruled by none If there is a poor man among your brothers within any of the gates in the land that the LORD your God is giving you then you are not to harden your heart or shut your hand from your poor brother Instead you are to open your hand to him and freely loan him whatever he needs Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought in your heart The seventh year the year of release is near so that you look upon your poor brother begrudgingly and give him nothing He will cry out to the LORD against you and you will be guilty of sin”

* DEU 15:10–17:14: “Give generously to him and do not let your heart be grieved when you do so And because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything to which you put your hand For there will never cease to be poor in the land that is why I am commanding you to open wide your hand to your brother and to the poor and needy in your land If a fellow Hebrew a man or a woman is sold to you and serves you six years then in the seventh year you must set him free And when you release him do not send him away empty-handed You are to furnish him liberally from your flock your threshing floor and your winepress You shall give to him as the LORD your God has blessed you Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you that is why I am giving you this command today But if your servant says to you I do not want to leave you because he loves you and your household and is well off with you then take an awl and pierce it through his ear into the door and he will become your servant for life And treat your maidservant the same way Do not regard it as a hardship to set your servant free because his six years of service were worth twice the wages of a hired hand And the LORD your God will bless you in all you do You must set apart to the LORD your God every firstborn male produced by your herds and flocks You are not to put the firstborn of your oxen to work nor are you to shear the firstborn of your flock Each year you and your household are to eat it before the LORD your God in the place the LORD will choose But if an animal has a defect is lame or blind or has any serious flaw you must not sacrifice it to the LORD your God Eat it within your gates both the ceremonially unclean and clean may eat it as they would a gazelle or a deer But you must not eat the blood pour it on the ground like water Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God because in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night You are to offer to the LORD your God the Passover sacrifice from the herd or flock in the place the LORD will choose as a dwelling for His Name You must not eat leavened bread with it for seven days you are to eat with it unleavened bread the bread of affliction because you left the land of Egypt in haste so that you may remember for the rest of your life the day you left the land of Egypt No leaven is to be found in all your land for seven days and none of the meat you sacrifice in the evening of the first day shall remain until morning You are not to sacrifice the Passover animal in any of the towns that the LORD your God is giving you You must only offer the Passover sacrifice at the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for His Name Do this in the evening as the sun sets at the same time you departed from Egypt And you shall roast it and eat it in the place the LORD your God will choose and in the morning you shall return to your tents For six days you must eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day you shall hold a solemn assembly to the LORD your God and you must not do any work You are to count off seven weeks from the time you first put the sickle to the standing grain And you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the LORD your God with a freewill offering that you give in proportion to how the LORD your God has blessed you and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in the place He will choose as a dwelling for His Name sons and daughters your menservants and maidservants and the Levite within your gates as well as the foreigner the fatherless and the widows among you Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and carefully follow these statutes You are to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress And you shall rejoice in your feast you your sons and daughters your menservants and maidservants and the Levite as well as the foreigner the fatherless and the widows among you For seven days you shall celebrate a feast to the LORD your God in the place He will choose because the LORD your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands so that your joy will be complete Three times a year all your men are to appear before the LORD your God in the place He will choose at the Feast of Unleavened Bread the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Tabernacles No one should appear before the LORD empty-handed Everyone must appear with a gift as he is able according to the blessing the LORD your God has given you You are to appoint judges and officials for your tribes in every town that the LORD your God is giving you They are to judge the people with righteous judgment Do not deny justice or show partiality Do not accept a bribe for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the righteous Pursue justice and justice alone so that you may live and you may possess the land that the LORD your God is giving you Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole next to the altar you will build for the LORD your God and do not set up for yourselves a sacred pillar which the LORD your God hates You shall not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or a sheep with any defect or serious flaw for that is detestable to the LORD your God If a man or woman among you in one of the towns that the LORD your God gives you is found doing evil in the sight of the LORD your God by transgressing His covenant and going to worship other gods bowing down to them or to the sun or moon or any of the host of heaven which I have forbidden and if it is reported and you hear about it you must investigate it thoroughly If the report is true and such an abomination has happened in Israel you must bring out to your gates the man or woman who has done this evil thing and you must stone that person to death On the testimony of two or three witnesses a man shall be put to death but he shall not be executed on the testimony of a lone witness The hands of the witnesses shall be the first in putting him to death and after that the hands of all the people So you must purge the evil from among you If a case is too difficult for you to judge whether the controversy within your gates is regarding bloodshed lawsuits or assaults you must go up to the place the LORD your God will choose You are to go to the Levitical priests and to the judge who presides at that time Inquire of them and they will give you a verdict in the case You must abide by the verdict they give you at the place the LORD will choose Be careful to do everything they instruct you according to the terms of law they give and the verdict they proclaim Do not turn aside to the right or to the left from the decision they declare to you But the man who acts presumptuously refusing to listen either to the priest who stands there to serve the LORD your God or to the judge must be put to death You must purge the evil from Israel Then all the people will hear and be afraid and will no longer behave arrogantly When you enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it and you say Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us”

* DEU 17:15–16: “you are to appoint over yourselves the king whom the LORD your God shall choose Appoint a king from among your brothers you are not to set over yourselves a foreigner who is not one of your brothers But the king must not acquire many horses for himself or send the people back to Egypt to acquire more horses for the LORD has said You are never to go back that way again”

* DEU 17:17–18:16: “He must not take many wives for himself lest his heart go astray He must not accumulate for himself large amounts of silver and gold When he is seated on his royal throne he must write for himself a copy of this instruction on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests It is to remain with him and he is to read from it all the days of his life so that he may learn to fear the LORD his God by carefully observing all the words of this instruction and these statutes Then his heart will not be exalted above his countrymen and he will not turn aside from the commandment to the right or to the left in order that he and his sons may reign many years over his kingdom in Israel The Levitical priests indeed the whole tribe of Levi shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel They are to eat the food offerings to the LORD that is their inheritance Although they have no inheritance among their brothers the LORD is their inheritance as He promised them This shall be the priests share from the people who offer a sacrifice whether a bull or a sheep the priests are to be given the shoulder the jowls and the stomach You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain new wine and oil and the first wool sheared from your flock For the LORD your God has chosen Levi and his sons out of all your tribes to stand and minister in His name for all time Now if a Levite moves from any town of residence throughout Israel and comes in all earnestness to the place the LORD will choose then he shall serve in the name of the LORD his God like all his fellow Levites who stand there before the LORD They shall eat equal portions even though he has received money from the sale of his father’s estate When you enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you do not imitate the detestable ways of the nations there Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire practices divination or conjury interprets omens practices sorcery casts spells consults a medium or spiritist or inquires of the dead For whoever does these things is detestable to the LORD And because of these detestable things the LORD your God is driving out the nations before you You must be blameless before the LORD your God Though these nations which you will dispossess listen to conjurers and diviners the LORD your God has not permitted you to do so The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers You must listen to him This is what you asked of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said Let us not hear the voice of the LORD our God or see this great fire anymore so that we will not die”

* DEU 18:17: “Then the LORD said to me They have spoken well”

* DEU 18:18: “I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers I will put My words in his mouth and he will tell them everything I command him”

* DEU 18:19: “And I will hold accountable anyone who does not listen to My words that the prophet speaks in My name”

* DEU 18:20: “But if any prophet dares to speak a message in My name that I have not commanded him to speak or to speak in the name of other gods that prophet must be put to death”

* DEU 18:21: “You may ask in your heart How can we recognize a message that the LORD has not spoken”

* DEU 18:22–19:7: “When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD and the message does not come to pass or come true that is a message the LORD has not spoken The prophet has spoken presumptuously Do not be afraid of him When the LORD your God has cut off the nations whose land He is giving you and when you have driven them out and settled in their cities and houses then you are to set apart for yourselves three cities within the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess You are to build roads for yourselves and divide into three regions the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance so that any manslayer can flee to these cities Now this is the situation regarding the manslayer who flees to one of these cities to save his life having killed his neighbor accidentally without intending to harm him If he goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut timber and swings his axe to chop down a tree but the blade flies off the handle and strikes and kills his neighbor he may flee to one of these cities to save his life Otherwise the avenger of blood might pursue the manslayer in a rage overtake him if the distance is great and strike him dead though he did not deserve to die since he did not intend any harm This is why I am commanding you to set apart three cities”

* DEU 19:8–20:3: “And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory as He swore to your fathers and gives you all the land He promised them and if you carefully keep all these commandments I am giving you today loving the LORD your God and walking in His ways at all times then you are to add three more cities to these three Thus innocent blood will not be shed in the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed If however a man hates his neighbor and lies in wait attacks him and kills him and then flees to one of these cities the elders of his city must send for him bring him back and hand him over to the avenger of blood to die You must show him no pity You are to purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood that it may go well with you You must not move your neighbor’s boundary marker which was set up by your ancestors to mark the inheritance you shall receive in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess A lone witness is not sufficient to establish any wrongdoing or sin against a man regardless of what offense he may have committed A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses If a false witness testifies against someone accusing him of a crime both parties to the dispute must stand in the presence of the LORD before the priests and judges who are in office at that time The judges shall investigate thoroughly and if the witness is proven to be a liar who has falsely accused his brother you must do to him as he intended to do to his brother So you must purge the evil from among you Then the rest of the people will hear and be afraid and they will never again do anything so evil among you You must show no pity life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand and foot for foot When you go out to war against your enemies and see horses chariots and an army larger than yours do not be afraid of them for the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt is with you When you are about to go into battle the priest is to come forward and address the army saying to them Hear O Israel today you are going into battle with your enemies Do not be fainthearted or afraid do not be alarmed or terrified because of them”

* DEU 20:4: “For the LORD your God goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you the victory”

* DEU 20:5: “Furthermore the officers are to address the army saying Has any man built a new house and not dedicated it Let him return home or he may die in battle and another man dedicate it”

* DEU 20:6: “Has any man planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy its fruit Let him return home or he may die in battle and another man enjoy its fruit”

* DEU 20:7: “Has any man become pledged to a woman and not married her Let him return home or he may die in battle and another man marry her”

* DEU 20:8: “Then the officers shall speak further to the army saying Is any man afraid or fainthearted Let him return home so that the hearts of his brothers will not melt like his own”

* DEU 20:9–21:7: “When the officers have finished addressing the army they are to appoint commanders to lead it When you approach a city to fight against it you are to make an offer of peace If they accept your offer of peace and open their gates all the people there will become forced laborers to serve you But if they refuse to make peace with you and wage war against you lay siege to that city When the LORD your God has delivered it into your hand you must put every male to the sword But the women children livestock and whatever else is in the city all its spoil you may take as plunder and you shall use the spoil of your enemies that the LORD your God gives you This is how you are to treat all the cities that are far away from you and do not belong to the nations nearby However in the cities of the nations that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance you must not leave alive anything that breathes For you must devote them to complete destruction the Hittites Amorites Canaanites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites as the LORD your God has commanded you so that they cannot teach you to do all the detestable things they do for their gods and so cause you to sin against the LORD your God When you lay siege to a city for an extended time while fighting against it to capture it you must not destroy its trees by putting an axe to them because you can eat their fruit You must not cut them down Are the trees of the field human that you should besiege them But you may destroy the trees that you know do not produce fruit Use them to build siege works against the city that is waging war against you until it falls If one is found slain lying in a field in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess and it is not known who killed him your elders and judges must come out and measure the distance from the victim to the neighboring cities Then the elders of the city nearest the victim shall take a heifer that has never been yoked or used for work bring the heifer to a valley with running water that has not been plowed or sown and break its neck there by the stream And the priests the sons of Levi shall come forward for the LORD your God has chosen them to serve Him and pronounce blessings in His name and to give a ruling in every dispute and case of assault Then all the elders of the city nearest the victim shall wash their hands by the stream over the heifer whose neck has been broken and they shall declare Our hands did not shed this blood nor did our eyes see it”

* DEU 21:8: “Accept this atonement O LORD for Your people Israel whom You have redeemed and do not hold the shedding of innocent blood against them And the bloodshed will be atoned for”

* DEU 21:9–20: “So you shall purge from among you the guilt of shedding innocent blood since you have done what is right in the eyes of the LORD When you go to war against your enemies and the LORD your God delivers them into your hand and you take them captive if you see a beautiful woman among them and you desire her and want to take her as your wife then you shall bring her into your house She must shave her head trim her nails and put aside the clothing of her captivity After she has lived in your house a full month and mourned her father and mother you may have relations with her and be her husband and she shall be your wife And if you are not pleased with her you are to let her go wherever she wishes But you must not sell her for money or treat her as a slave since you have dishonored her If a man has two wives one beloved and the other unloved and both bear him sons but the unloved wife has the firstborn son when that man assigns his inheritance to his sons he must not appoint the son of the beloved wife as the firstborn over the son of the unloved wife Instead he must acknowledge the firstborn the son of his unloved wife by giving him a double portion of all that he has For that son is the firstfruits of his father’s strength the right of the firstborn belongs to him If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and does not listen to them when disciplined his father and mother are to lay hold of him and bring him to the elders of his city to the gate of his hometown and say to the elders This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious he does not obey us He is a glutton and a drunkard”

* DEU 21:21–22:14: “Then all the men of his city will stone him to death So you must purge the evil from among you and all Israel will hear and be afraid If a man has committed a sin worthy of death and he is executed and you hang his body on a tree you must not leave the body on the tree overnight but you must be sure to bury him that day because anyone who is hung on a tree is under God’s curse You must not defile the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance If you see your brother’s ox or sheep straying you must not ignore it be sure to return it to your brother If your brother does not live near you or if you do not know who he is you are to take the animal home to remain with you until your brother comes seeking it then you can return it to him And you shall do the same for his donkey his cloak or anything your brother has lost and you have found You must not ignore it If you see your brother’s donkey or ox fallen on the road you must not ignore it you must help him lift it up A woman must not wear men’s clothing and a man must not wear women’s clothing for whoever does these things is detestable to the LORD your God If you come across a bird’s nest with chicks or eggs either in a tree or on the ground along the road and the mother is sitting on the chicks or eggs you must not take the mother along with the young You may take the young but be sure to let the mother go so that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days If you build a new house you are to construct a railing around your roof so that you do not bring bloodguilt on your house if someone falls from it Do not plant your vineyard with two types of seed if you do the entire harvest will be defiled both the crop you plant and the fruit of your vineyard Do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together You are to make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear Suppose a man marries a woman has relations with her and comes to hate her and he then accuses her of shameful conduct and gives her a bad name saying I married this woman and had relations with her but I discovered she was not a virgin”

* DEU 22:15–16: “Then the young woman’s father and mother shall bring the proof of her virginity to the city elders at the gate and say to the elders I gave my daughter in marriage to this man but he has come to hate her”

* DEU 22:17: “And now he has accused her of shameful conduct saying I discovered that your daughter was not a virgin But here is the proof of her virginity”

* DEU 22:18–25:7: “Then the elders of that city shall take the man and punish him They are also to fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the young woman’s father because this man has given a virgin of Israel a bad name And she shall remain his wife he must not divorce her as long as he lives If however this accusation is true and no proof of the young woman’s virginity can be found she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there the men of her city will stone her to death For she has committed an outrage in Israel by being promiscuous in her father’s house So you must purge the evil from among you If a man is found lying with another man’s wife both the man who slept with her and the woman must die You must purge the evil from Israel If there is a virgin pledged in marriage to a man and another man encounters her in the city and sleeps with her you must take both of them out to the gate of that city and stone them to death the young woman because she did not cry out in the city and the man because he has violated his neighbor’s wife So you must purge the evil from among you But if the man encounters a betrothed woman in the open country and he overpowers her and lies with her only the man who has done this must die Do nothing to the young woman because she has committed no sin worthy of death This case is just like one in which a man attacks his neighbor and murders him When he found her in the field the betrothed woman cried out but there was no one to save her If a man encounters a virgin who is not pledged in marriage and he seizes her and lies with her and they are discovered then the man who lay with her must pay the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver and she must become his wife because he has violated her He must not divorce her as long as he lives A man is not to marry his father’s wife so that he will not dishonor his father’s marriage bed No man with crushed or severed genitals may enter the assembly of the LORD No one of illegitimate birth may enter the assembly of the LORD nor may any of his descendants even to the tenth generation No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD even to the tenth generation For they did not meet you with food and water on your way out of Egypt and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram-naharaim to curse you Yet the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam and the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for you because the LORD your God loves you You are not to seek peace or prosperity from them as long as you live Do not despise an Edomite for he is your brother Do not despise an Egyptian because you lived as a foreigner in his land The third generation of children born to them may enter the assembly of the LORD When you are encamped against your enemies then you shall keep yourself from every wicked thing If any man among you becomes unclean because of a nocturnal emission he must leave the camp and stay outside When evening approaches he must wash with water and when the sun sets he may return to the camp You must have a place outside the camp to go and relieve yourself And you must have a digging tool in your equipment so that when you relieve yourself you can dig a hole and cover up your excrement For the LORD your God walks throughout your camp to protect you and deliver your enemies to you Your camp must be holy lest He see anything unclean among you and turn away from you Do not return a slave to his master if he has taken refuge with you Let him live among you wherever he chooses in the town of his pleasing Do not oppress him No daughter or son of Israel is to be a shrine prostitute You must not bring the wages of a prostitute whether female or male into the house of the LORD your God to fulfill any vow because both are detestable to the LORD your God Do not charge your brother interest on money food or any other type of loan You may charge a foreigner interest but not your brother so that the LORD your God may bless you in everything to which you put your hand in the land that you are entering to possess If you make a vow to the LORD your God do not be slow to keep it because He will surely require it of you and you will be guilty of sin But if you refrain from making a vow you will not be guilty of sin Be careful to follow through on what comes from your lips because you have freely vowed to the LORD your God with your own mouth When you enter your neighbor’s vineyard you may eat your fill of grapes but you must not put any in your basket When you enter your neighbor’s grainfield you may pluck the heads of grain with your hand but you must not put a sickle to your neighbor’s grain If a man marries a woman but she becomes displeasing to him because he finds some indecency in her he may write her a certificate of divorce hand it to her and send her away from his house If after leaving his house she goes and becomes another man’s wife and the second man hates her writes her a certificate of divorce hands it to her and sends her away from his house or if he dies then the husband who divorced her first may not remarry her after she has been defiled for that is an abomination to the LORD You must not bring sin upon the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance If a man is newly married he must not be sent to war or be pressed into any duty For one year he is free to stay at home and bring joy to the wife he has married Do not take a pair of millstones or even an upper millstone as security for a debt because that would be taking one’s livelihood as security If a man is caught kidnapping one of his Israelite brothers whether he treats him as a slave or sells him the kidnapper must die So you must purge the evil from among you In cases of infectious skin diseases be careful to diligently follow everything the Levitical priests instruct you Be careful to do as I have commanded them Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam on the journey after you came out of Egypt When you lend anything to your neighbor do not enter his house to collect security You are to stand outside while the man to whom you are lending brings the security out to you If he is a poor man you must not go to sleep with the security in your possession be sure to return it to him by sunset so that he may sleep in his own cloak and bless you and this will be credited to you as righteousness before the LORD your God Do not oppress a hired hand who is poor and needy whether he is a brother or a foreigner residing in one of your towns You are to pay his wages each day before sunset because he is poor and depends on them Otherwise he may cry out to the LORD against you and you will be guilty of sin Fathers shall not be put to death for their children nor children for their fathers each is to die for his own sin Do not deny justice to the foreigner or the fatherless and do not take a widow’s cloak as security Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you from that place Therefore I am commanding you to do this If you are harvesting in your field and forget a sheaf there do not go back to get it It is to be left for the foreigner the fatherless and the widow so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands When you beat the olives from your trees you must not go over the branches again What remains will be for the foreigner the fatherless and the widow When you gather the grapes of your vineyard you must not go over the vines again What remains will be for the foreigner the fatherless and the widow Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt Therefore I am commanding you to do this If there is a dispute between men they are to go to court to be judged so that the innocent may be acquitted and the guilty condemned If the guilty man deserves to be beaten the judge shall have him lie down and be flogged in his presence with the number of lashes his crime warrants He may receive no more than forty lashes lest your brother be beaten any more than that and be degraded in your sight Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain When brothers dwell together and one of them dies without a son the widow must not marry outside the family Her husband’s brother is to take her as his wife and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law for her The first son she bears will carry on the name of the dead brother so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel But if the man does not want to marry his brother’s widow she is to go to the elders at the city gate and say My husband’s brother refuses to preserve his brother’s name in Israel He is not willing to perform the duty of a brother-in-law for me”

* DEU 25:8: “Then the elders of his city shall summon him and speak with him If he persists and says I do not want to marry her”

* DEU 25:9: “his brother’s widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders remove his sandal spit in his face and declare This is what is done to the man who will not maintain his brother’s line”

* DEU 25:10: “And his family name in Israel will be called The House of the Unsandaled”

* DEU 25:11–26:3: “If two men are fighting and the wife of one comes to rescue her husband from the one striking him and she reaches out her hand and grabs his genitals you are to cut off her hand You must show her no pity You shall not have two differing weights in your bag one heavy and one light You shall not have two differing measures in your house one large and one small You must maintain accurate and honest weights and measures so that you may live long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you For everyone who behaves dishonestly in regard to these things is detestable to the LORD your God Remember what the Amalekites did to you along your way from Egypt how they met you on your journey when you were tired and weary and they attacked all your stragglers they had no fear of God When the LORD your God gives you rest from the enemies around you in the land that He is giving you to possess as an inheritance you are to blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven Do not forget When you enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance and you take possession of it and settle in it you are to take some of the firstfruits of all your produce from the soil of the land that the LORD your God is giving you and put them in a basket Then go to the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for His Name to the priest who is serving at that time and say to him I declare today to the LORD your God that I have entered the land that the LORD swore to our fathers to give us”

* DEU 26:4–5: “Then the priest shall take the basket from your hands and place it before the altar of the LORD your God and you are to declare before the LORD your God My father was a wandering Aramean and he went down to Egypt few in number and lived there and became a great nation mighty and numerous”

* DEU 26:6: “But the Egyptians mistreated us and afflicted us putting us to hard labor”

* DEU 26:7: “So we called out to the LORD the God of our fathers and the LORD heard our voice and saw our affliction toil and oppression”

* DEU 26:8: “Then the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm with great terror signs and wonders”

* DEU 26:9: “And He brought us to this place and gave us this land a land flowing with milk and honey”

* DEU 26:10: “And now behold I have brought the firstfruits of the land that You O LORD have given me Then you are to place the basket before the LORD your God and bow down before Him”

* DEU 26:11–13: “So you shall rejoice you the Levite and the foreigner dwelling among you in all the good things the LORD your God has given to you and your household When you have finished laying aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year the year of the tithe you are to give it to the Levite the foreigner the fatherless and the widow that they may eat and be filled within your gates Then you shall declare in the presence of the LORD your God I have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the Levite the foreigner the fatherless and the widow according to all the commandments You have given me I have not transgressed or forgotten Your commandments”

* DEU 26:14: “I have not eaten any of the sacred portion while in mourning or removed any of it while unclean or offered any of it for the dead I have obeyed the LORD my God I have done everything You commanded me”

* DEU 26:15: “Look down from Your holy habitation from heaven and bless Your people Israel and the land You have given us as You swore to our fathers a land flowing with milk and honey”

* DEU 26:16–19: “The LORD your God commands you this day to follow these statutes and ordinances You must be careful to follow them with all your heart and with all your soul Today you have proclaimed that the LORD is your God and that you will walk in His ways keep His statutes and commandments and ordinances and listen to His voice And today the LORD has proclaimed that you are His people and treasured possession as He promised that you are to keep all His commandments that He will set you high in praise and name and honor above all the nations He has made and that you will be a holy people to the LORD your God as He has promised”

* DEU 27:1–8: “Keep all the commandments I am giving you today And on the day you cross the Jordan into the land that the LORD your God is giving you set up large stones and coat them with plaster Write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over to enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you a land flowing with milk and honey just as the LORD the God of your fathers has promised you And when you have crossed the Jordan you are to set up these stones on Mount Ebal as I am commanding you today and you are to coat them with plaster Moreover you are to build there an altar to the LORD your God an altar of stones You must not use any iron tool on them You shall build the altar of the LORD your God with uncut stones and offer upon it burnt offerings to the LORD your God There you are to sacrifice your peace offerings eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God And you shall write distinctly upon these stones all the words of this law”

* DEU 27:9–10: “Be silent O Israel and listen This day you have become the people of the LORD your God You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God and follow His commandments and statutes I am giving you today”

* DEU 27:12–28:68: “When you have crossed the Jordan these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people Simeon Levi Judah Issachar Joseph and Benjamin And these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to deliver the curse Reuben Gad Asher Zebulun Dan and Naphtali Then the Levites shall proclaim in a loud voice to every Israelite Cursed is the man who makes a carved idol or molten image an abomination to the LORD the work of the hands of a craftsman and sets it up in secret And let all the people say Amen Cursed is he who dishonors his father or mother And let all the people say Amen Cursed is he who moves his neighbor’s boundary stone And let all the people say Amen Cursed is he who lets a blind man wander in the road And let all the people say Amen Cursed is he who withholds justice from the foreigner the fatherless or the widow And let all the people say Amen Cursed is he who sleeps with his father’s wife for he has violated his father’s marriage bed And let all the people say Amen Cursed is he who lies with any animal And let all the people say Amen Cursed is he who sleeps with his sister the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother And let all the people say Amen Cursed is he who sleeps with his mother-in-law And let all the people say Amen Cursed is he who strikes down his neighbor in secret And let all the people say Amen Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person And let all the people say Amen Cursed is he who does not put the words of this law into practice And let all the people say Amen Now if you faithfully obey the voice of the LORD your God and are careful to follow all His commandments I am giving you today the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth And all these blessings will come upon you and overtake you if you will obey the voice of the LORD your God You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country The fruit of your womb will be blessed as well as the produce of your land and the offspring of your livestock the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks Your basket and kneading bowl will be blessed You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out The LORD will cause the enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you They will march out against you in one direction but flee from you in seven The LORD will decree a blessing on your barns and on everything to which you put your hand the LORD your God will bless you in the land He is giving you The LORD will establish you as His holy people just as He has sworn to you if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God and walk in His ways Then all the peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of the LORD and they will stand in awe of you The LORD will make you prosper abundantly in the fruit of your womb the offspring of your livestock and the produce of your land in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give you The LORD will

destroyed They will leave you no grain or new wine or oil no calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until they have caused you to perish They will besiege all the cities throughout your land

brother the wife he embraces and the rest of his children who have survived refusing to share with any of them the flesh of his children he will eat because he has nothing left in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you within all your gates The most gentle and refined woman among you so gentle and refined she would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground will begrudge the husband she embraces and her son and daughter the afterbirth that comes from between her legs and the children she bears because she will secretly eat them for lack of anything else in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you within your gates If you are not careful to observe all the words of this law which are written in this book that you may fear this glorious and awesome name the LORD your God He will bring upon you and your descendants extraordinary disasters severe and lasting plagues and terrible and chronic sicknesses He will afflict you again with all the diseases you dreaded in Egypt and they will cling to you The LORD will also bring upon you every sickness and plague not recorded in this Book of the Law until you are destroyed You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left few in number because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and multiply so also it will please Him to annihilate you and destroy you And you will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess Then the LORD will scatter you among all the nations from one end of the earth to the other and there you will worship other gods gods of wood and stone which neither you nor your fathers have known Among those nations you will find no repose not even a resting place for the sole of your foot There the LORD will give you a trembling heart failing eyes and a despairing soul So your life will hang in doubt before you and you will be afraid night and day never certain of survival In the morning you will say If only it were evening and in the evening you will say If only it were morning because of the dread in your hearts of the terrifying sights you will see The LORD will return you to Egypt in ships by a route that I said you should never see again There you will sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves but no one will buy you”

* DEU 29:1–18: “You have seen with your own eyes everything the LORD did in Egypt to Pharaoh to all his officials and to all his land You saw with your own eyes the great trials and those miraculous signs and wonders Yet to this day the LORD has not given you a mind to understand eyes to see or ears to hear For forty years I led you in the wilderness yet your clothes and sandals did not wear out You ate no bread and drank no wine or strong drink so that you might know that I am the LORD your God When you reached this place Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us in battle but we defeated them We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh So keep and follow the words of this covenant that you may prosper in all you do All of you are standing today before the LORD your God you leaders of tribes elders officials and all the men of Israel your children and wives and the foreigners in your camps who cut your wood and draw your water so that you may enter into the covenant of the LORD your God which He is making with you today and into His oath and so that He may establish you today as His people and He may be your God as He promised you and as He swore to your fathers to Abraham Isaac and Jacob I am making this covenant and this oath not only with you but also with those who are standing here with us today in the presence of the LORD our God as well as with those who are not here today For you yourselves know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we passed through the nations on the way here You saw the abominations and idols among them made of wood and stone of silver and gold Make sure there is no man or woman clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the LORD our God to go and worship the gods of those nations Make sure there is no root among you that bears such poisonous and bitter fruit because when such a person hears the words of this oath he invokes a blessing on himself saying I will have peace even though I walk in the stubbornness of my own heart”

* DEU 29:18–22: “This will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry The LORD will never be willing to forgive him Instead His anger and jealousy will burn against that man and every curse written in this book will fall upon him The LORD will blot out his name from under heaven and single him out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law Then the generation to come your sons who follow you and the foreigner who comes from a distant land will see the plagues of the land and the sicknesses the LORD has inflicted on it All its soil will be a burning waste of sulfur and salt unsown and unproductive with no growing”

* DEU 29:22–30:20: “plant just like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah Admah and Zeboiim which the LORD overthrew in His fierce anger So all the nations will ask Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land Why this great outburst of anger And the people will answer It is because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD the God of their fathers which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt They went and served other gods and they worshiped gods they had not known gods that the LORD had not given to them Therefore the anger of the LORD burned against this land and He brought upon it every curse written in this book The LORD uprooted them from their land in His anger rage and great wrath and He cast them into another land where they are today The secret things belong to the LORD our God but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever so that we may follow all the words of this law When all these things come upon you the blessings and curses I have set before you and you call them to mind in all the nations to which the LORD your God has banished you and when you and your children return to the LORD your God and obey His voice with all your heart and all your soul according to everything I am giving you today then He will restore you from captivity and have compassion on you and gather you from all the nations to which the LORD your God has scattered you Even if you have been banished to the farthest horizon He will gather you and return you from there And the LORD your God will bring you into the land your fathers possessed and you will take possession of it He will cause you to prosper and multiply more than your fathers The LORD your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants and you will love Him with all your heart and with all your soul so that you may live Then the LORD your God will put all these curses upon your enemies who hate you and persecute you And you will again obey the voice of the LORD and follow all His commandments I am giving you today So the LORD your God will make you abound in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb the offspring of your livestock and the produce of your land Indeed the LORD will again delight in your prosperity as He delighted in that of your fathers if you obey the LORD your God by keeping His commandments and statutes that are written in this Book of the Law and if you turn to Him with all your heart and with all your soul For this commandment I give you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach It is not in heaven that you should need to ask Who will ascend into heaven to get it for us and proclaim it that we may obey it And it is not beyond the sea that you should need to ask Who will cross the sea to get it for us and proclaim it that we may obey it But the word is very near you it is in your mouth and in your heart so that you may obey it See I have set before you today life and prosperity as well as death and disaster For I am commanding you today to love the LORD your God to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments statutes and ordinances so that you may live and increase and the LORD your God may bless you in the land that you are entering to possess But if your heart turns away and you do not listen but are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them I declare to you today that you will surely perish you shall not prolong your days in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing Therefore choose life so that you and your descendants may live and that you may love the LORD your God obey Him and hold fast to Him For He is your life and He will prolong your life in the land that the LORD swore to give to your fathers to Abraham Isaac and Jacob”

* DEU 31:2–6: “now a hundred and twenty years old I am no longer able to come and go and the LORD has said to me You shall not cross the Jordan The LORD your God Himself will cross over ahead of you He will destroy these nations before you and you will dispossess them Joshua will cross ahead of you as the LORD has said And the LORD will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og the kings of the Amorites when He destroyed them along with their land The LORD will deliver them over to you and you must do to them exactly as I have commanded you Be strong and courageous do not be afraid or terrified of them for it is the LORD your God who goes with you He will never leave you nor forsake you”

* DEU 31:26–29: “Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God so that it may remain there as a witness against you For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are If you are already rebelling against the LORD while I am still alive how much more will you rebel after my death Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officers so that I may speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them For I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt and turn from the path I have commanded you And in the days to come disaster will befall you because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger by the work of your hands”
