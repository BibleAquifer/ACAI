* EZR 4:12–16 (letter): “Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came from you to us have returned to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city They are restoring its walls and repairing its foundations Let it now be known to the king that if that city is rebuilt and its walls are restored they will not pay tribute duty or toll and the royal treasury will suffer Now because we are in the service of the palace and it is not fitting for us to allow the king to be dishonored we have sent to inform the king that a search should be made of the record books of your fathers In these books you will discover and verify that the city is a rebellious city harmful to kings and provinces inciting sedition from ancient times That is why this city was destroyed We advise the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are restored you will have no dominion west of the Euphrates”
