* 2KI 18:19–25: “Tell Hezekiah that this is what the great king the king of Assyria says What is the basis of this confidence of yours You claim to have a strategy and strength for war but these are empty words In whom are you now trusting that you have rebelled against me Look now you are trusting in Egypt that splintered reed of a staff that will pierce the hand of anyone who leans on it Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him But if you say to me We trust in the LORD our God is He not the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed saying to Judah and Jerusalem You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem Now therefore make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria I will give you two thousand horses if you can put riders on them For how can you repel a single officer among the least of my master’s servants when you depend on Egypt for chariots and horsemen So now was it apart from the LORD that I have come up against this place to destroy it The LORD Himself said to me Go up against this land and destroy it”
