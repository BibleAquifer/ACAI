* 2CH 13:4–12: “Hear me O Jeroboam and all Israel Do you not know that the LORD the God of Israel has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat a servant of Solomon son of David rose up and rebelled against his master Then worthless and wicked men gathered around him to resist Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young inexperienced and unable to resist them And now you think you can resist the kingdom of the LORD which is in the hands of David’s descendants You are indeed a vast army and you have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods But did you not drive out the priests of the LORD the sons of Aaron and the Levites And did you not make priests for yourselves as do the peoples of other lands Now whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams can become a priest of things that are not gods But as for us the LORD is our God We have not forsaken Him the priests who minister to the LORD are sons of Aaron and the Levites attend to their duties Every morning and every evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the LORD They set out the rows of showbread on the ceremonially clean table and every evening they light the lamps of the gold lampstand We are carrying out the requirements of the LORD our God while you have forsaken Him Now behold God Himself is with us as our head and His priests with their trumpets sound the battle call against you O children of Israel do not fight against the LORD the God of your fathers for you will not succeed”
