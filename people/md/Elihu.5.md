* JOB 32:6–33:33: “I am young in years while you are old that is why I was timid and afraid to tell you what I know I thought that age should speak and many years should teach wisdom But there is a spirit in a man the breath of the Almighty that gives him understanding It is not only the old who are wise or the elderly who understand justice Therefore I say Listen to me I too will declare what I know Indeed I waited while you spoke I listened to your reasoning as you searched for words I paid you full attention But no one proved Job wrong not one of you rebutted his arguments So do not claim We have found wisdom let God not man refute him But Job has not directed his words against me and I will not answer him with your arguments Job’s friends are dismayed with no more to say words have escaped them Must I wait now that they are silent now that they stand and no longer reply I too will answer yes I will declare what I know For I am full of words and my spirit within me compels me Behold my belly is like unvented wine it is about to burst like a new wineskin I must speak and find relief I must open my lips and respond I will be partial to no one nor will I flatter any man For I do not know how to flatter or my Maker would remove me in an instant But now O Job hear my speech and listen to all my words Behold I will open my mouth my address is on the tip of my tongue My words are from an upright heart and my lips speak sincerely what I know The Spirit of God has made me and the breath of the Almighty gives me life Refute me if you can prepare your case and confront me I am just like you before God I was also formed from clay Surely no fear of me should terrify you nor will my hand be heavy upon you Surely you have spoken in my hearing and I have heard these very words I am pure without transgression I am clean with no iniquity in me Yet God finds occasions against me He counts me as His enemy He puts my feet in the stocks He watches over all my paths Behold you are not right in this matter I will answer you for God is greater than man Why do you complain to Him that He answers nothing a man asks For God speaks in one way and in another yet no one notices In a dream in a vision in the night when deep sleep falls upon men as they slumber on their beds He opens their ears and terrifies them with warnings to turn a man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride to preserve his soul from the Pit and his life from perishing by the sword A man is also chastened on his bed with pain and constant distress in his bones so that he detests his bread and his soul loathes his favorite food His flesh wastes away from sight and his hidden bones protrude He draws near to the Pit and his life to the messengers of death Yet if there is a messenger on his side one mediator in a thousand to tell a man what is right for him to be gracious to him and say Spare him from going down to the Pit I have found his ransom then his flesh is refreshed like a child’s he returns to the days of his youth He prays to God and finds favor he sees God’s face and shouts for joy and God restores His righteousness to that man Then he sings before men with these words I have sinned and perverted what was right yet I did not get what I deserved He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit and I will live to see the light Behold all these things God does to a man two or even three times to bring back his soul from the Pit that he may be enlightened with the light of life Pay attention Job and listen to me be silent and I will speak But if you have something to say answer me speak up for I would like to vindicate you But if not then listen to me be quiet and I will teach you wisdom”

* JOB 34:2–37: “Hear my words O wise men give ear to me O men of learning For the ear tests words as the mouth tastes food Let us choose for ourselves what is right let us learn together what is good For Job has declared I am righteous yet God has deprived me of justice Would I lie about my case My wound is incurable though I am without transgression What man is like Job who drinks up derision like water He keeps company with evildoers and walks with wicked men For he has said It profits a man nothing that he should delight in God Therefore listen to me O men of understanding Far be it from God to do wrong and from the Almighty to act unjustly For according to a man’s deeds He repays him according to a man’s ways He brings consequences Indeed it is true that God does not act wickedly and the Almighty does not pervert justice Who gave Him charge over the earth Who appointed Him over the whole world If He were to set His heart to it and withdraw His Spirit and breath all flesh would perish together and mankind would return to the dust If you have understanding hear this listen to my words Could one who hates justice govern Will you condemn the just and mighty One who says to kings You are worthless and to nobles You are wicked who is not partial to princes and does not favor rich over poor For they are all the work of His hands They die in an instant in the middle of the night The people convulse and pass away the mighty are removed without human hand For His eyes are on the ways of a man and He sees his every step There is no darkness or deep shadow where the workers of iniquity can hide For God need not examine a man further or have him approach for judgment He shatters the mighty without inquiry and sets up others in their place Therefore He recognizes their deeds He overthrows them in the night and they are crushed He strikes them for their wickedness in full view because they turned aside from Him and had no regard for any of His ways They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him and He heard the outcry of the afflicted But when He remains silent who can condemn Him When He hides His face who can see Him Yet He watches over both man and nation that godless men should not rule or lay snares for the people Suppose someone says to God I have endured my punishment I will offend no more Teach me what I cannot see if I have done wrong I will not do it again Should God repay you on your own terms when you have disavowed Him You must choose not I so tell me what you know Men of understanding will declare to me and the wise men who hear me will say Job speaks without knowledge his words lack insight If only Job were tried to the utmost for answering like a wicked man For he adds rebellion to his sin he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God”

* JOB 35:2–16: “Do you think this is just You say I am more righteous than For you ask What does it profit me and what benefit do I gain apart from sin I will reply to you and to your friends as well Look to the heavens and see gaze at the clouds high above you If you sin what do you accomplish against Him If you multiply your transgressions what do you do to Him If you are righteous what do you give Him or what does He receive from your hand Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself and your righteousness only a son of man Men cry out under great oppression they plead for relief from the arm of the mighty But no one asks Where is God my Maker who gives us songs in the night who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air There they cry out but He does not answer because of the pride of evil men Surely God does not listen to empty pleas and the Almighty does not take note of it How much less then when you say that you do not see Him that your case is before Him and you must wait for Him and further that in His anger He has not punished or taken much notice of folly So Job opens his mouth in vain and multiplies words without knowledge”

* JOB 36:2–37:24: “Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said on God’s behalf I get my knowledge from afar and I will ascribe justice to my Maker For truly my words are free of falsehood one perfect in knowledge is with you Indeed God is mighty but He despises no one He is mighty in strength of understanding He does not keep the wicked alive but He grants justice to the afflicted He does not take His eyes off the righteous but He enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever And if men are bound with chains caught in cords of affliction then He tells them their deeds and how arrogantly they have transgressed He opens their ears to correction and commands that they turn from iniquity If they obey and serve Him then they end their days in prosperity and their years in happiness But if they do not obey then they perish by the sword and die without knowledge The godless in heart harbor resentment even when He binds them they do not cry for help They die in their youth among the male shrine prostitutes God rescues the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ears in oppression Indeed He drew you from the jaws of distress to a spacious and broad place to a table full of richness But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked judgment and justice have seized you Be careful that no one lures you with riches do not let a large bribe lead you astray Can your wealth or all your mighty effort keep you from distress Do not long for the night when people vanish from their homes Be careful not to turn to iniquity for this you have preferred to affliction Behold God is exalted in His power Who is a teacher like Him Who has appointed His way for Him or told Him You have done wrong Remember to magnify His work which men have praised in song All mankind has seen it men behold it from afar Indeed God is great beyond our knowledge the number of His years is unsearchable For He draws up drops of water which distill the rain from the mist which the clouds pour out and shower abundantly on mankind Furthermore who can understand how the clouds spread out how the thunder roars from His pavilion See how He scatters His lightning around Him and covers the depths of the sea For by these He judges the nations and provides food in abundance He fills His hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark The thunder declares His presence even the cattle regard the rising storm At this my heart also pounds and leaps from its place Listen closely to the thunder of His voice and the rumbling that comes from His mouth He unleashes His lightning beneath the whole sky and sends it to the ends of the earth Then there comes a roaring sound He thunders with His majestic voice He does not restrain the lightning when His voice resounds God thunders wondrously with His voice He does great things we cannot comprehend For He says to the snow Fall on the earth and to the gentle rain Pour out a mighty downpour He seals up the hand of every man so that all men may know His work The wild animals enter their lairs they settle down in their dens The tempest comes from its chamber and the cold from the driving north winds By the breath of God the ice is formed and the watery expanses are frozen He loads the clouds with moisture He scatters His lightning through them They swirl about whirling at His direction accomplishing all that He commands over the face of all the earth Whether for punishment or for His land He accomplishes this in His loving devotion Listen to this O Job stand still and consider the wonders of God Do you know how God dispatches the clouds or makes the lightning flash Do you understand how the clouds float those wonders of Him who is perfect in knowledge You whose clothes get hot when the land lies hushed under the south wind can you like Him spread out the skies as strong as a mirror of bronze Teach us what we should say to Him we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness Should He be told that I want to speak Would a man ask to be swallowed up Now no one can gaze at the sun when it is bright in the skies after the wind has swept them clean Out of the north He comes in golden splendor awesome majesty surrounds Him The Almighty is beyond our reach He is exalted in power In His justice and great righteousness He does not oppress Therefore men fear Him for He is not partial to the wise in heart”
