* PRO 1:22–33: “How long O simple ones will you love your simple ways How long will scoffers delight in their scorn and fools hate knowledge If you had repented at my rebuke then surely I would have poured out my spirit on you I would have made my words known to you Because you refused my call and no one took my outstretched hand because you neglected all my counsel and wanted none of my correction in turn I will mock your calamity I will sneer when terror strikes you when your dread comes like a storm and your destruction like a whirlwind when distress and anguish overwhelm you Then they will call on me but I will not answer they will earnestly seek me but will not find me For they hated knowledge and chose not to fear the LORD They accepted none of my counsel they despised all my reproof So they will eat the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices For the waywardness of the simple will slay them and the complacency of fools will destroy them But whoever listens to me will dwell in safety secure from the fear of evil”

* PRO 8:4–36: “To you O men I call out and my cry is to the sons of men O simple ones learn to be shrewd O fools gain understanding Listen for I speak of noble things and the opening of my lips will reveal right For my mouth will speak the truth and wickedness is detestable to my lips All the words of my mouth are righteous none are crooked or perverse They are all plain to the discerning and upright to those who find knowledge Receive my instruction instead of silver and knowledge rather than pure gold For wisdom is more precious than rubies and nothing you desire compares with her I wisdom dwell together with prudence and I find knowledge and discretion To fear the LORD is to hate evil I hate arrogant pride evil conduct and perverse speech Counsel and sound judgment are mine I have insight and strength By me kings reign and rulers enact just laws By me princes rule and all nobles who govern justly I love those who love me and those who seek me early shall find me With me are riches and honor enduring wealth and righteousness My fruit is better than gold pure gold and my harvest surpasses choice silver I walk in the way of righteousness along the paths of justice bestowing wealth on those who love me and making their treasuries full The LORD created me as His first course before His works of old From everlasting I was established from the beginning before the earth began When there were no watery depths I was brought forth when no springs were overflowing with water Before the mountains were settled before the hills I was brought forth before He made the land or fields or any of the dust of the earth I was there when He established the heavens when He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep when He established the clouds above when the fountains of the deep gushed forth when He set a boundary for the sea so that the waters would not surpass His command when He marked out the foundations of the earth Then I was a skilled craftsman at His side and His delight day by day rejoicing always in His presence I was rejoicing in His whole world delighting together in the sons of men Now therefore my sons listen to me for blessed are those who keep my ways Listen to instruction and be wise do not ignore it Blessed is the man who listens to me watching daily at my doors waiting at the posts of my doorway For whoever finds me finds life and obtains the favor of the LORD But he who fails to find me harms himself all who hate me love death”

* PRO 9:4: “Whoever is simple let him turn in here”

* PRO 9:5–6: “Come eat my bread and drink the wine I have mixed Leave your folly behind and you will live walk in the way of understanding”
