* JOB 3:3–26: “May the day of my birth perish and the night it was said A boy is conceived If only that day had turned to darkness May God above disregard it may no light shine upon it May darkness and gloom reclaim it and a cloud settle over it may the blackness of the day overwhelm it If only darkness had taken that night away May it not appear among the days of the year may it never be entered in any of the months Behold may that night be barren may no joyful voice come into it May it be cursed by those who curse the day those prepared to rouse Leviathan May its morning stars grow dark may it wait in vain for daylight may it not see the breaking of dawn For that night did not shut the doors of the womb to hide the sorrow from my eyes Why did I not perish at birth why did I not die as I came from the womb Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I should be nursed For now I would be lying down in peace I would be asleep and at rest with kings and counselors of the earth who built for themselves cities now in ruins or with princes who had gold who filled their houses with silver Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child like an infant who never sees daylight There the wicked cease from raging and there the weary find rest The captives enjoy their ease they do not hear the voice of the oppressor Both small and great are there and the slave is freed from his master Why is light given to the miserable and life to the bitter of soul who long for death that does not come and search for it like hidden treasure who rejoice and greatly exult when they reach the grave Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden whom God has hedged in I sigh when food is put before me and my groans pour out like water For the thing I feared has overtaken me and what I dreaded has befallen me I am not at ease or quiet I have no rest for trouble has come”

* JOB 6:2–7:21: “If only my grief could be weighed and placed with my calamity on the scales For then it would outweigh the sand of the seas no wonder my words have been rash For the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me my spirit drinks in their poison the terrors of God are arrayed against me Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass or an ox low over its fodder Is tasteless food eaten without salt or is there flavor in the white of an egg My soul refuses to touch them they are loathsome food to me If only my request were granted and God would fulfill my hope that God would be willing to crush me to unleash His hand and cut me off It still brings me comfort and joy through unrelenting pain that I have not denied the words of the Holy One What strength do I have that I should still hope What is my future that I should be patient Is my strength like that of stone or my flesh made of bronze Is there any help within me now that success is driven from me A despairing man should have the kindness of his friend even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty But my brothers are as faithless as wadis as seasonal streams that overflow darkened because of the ice and the inflow of melting snow but ceasing in the dry season and vanishing from their channels in the heat Caravans turn aside from their routes they go into the wasteland and perish The caravans of Tema look for water the travelers of Sheba hope to find it They are confounded because they had hoped their arrival brings disappointment For now you are of no help you see terror and you are afraid Have I ever said Give me something offer me a bribe from your wealth deliver me from the hand of the enemy redeem me from the grasp of the ruthless Teach me and I will be silent Help me understand how I have erred How painful are honest words But what does your argument prove Do you intend to correct my words and treat as wind my cry of despair You would even cast lots for an orphan and barter away your friend But now please look at me Would I lie to your face Reconsider do not be unjust Reconsider for my righteousness is at stake Is there iniquity on my tongue Can my mouth not discern malice Is not man consigned to labor on earth Are not his days like those of a hired hand Like a slave he longs for shade like a hireling he waits for his wages So I am allotted months of futility and nights of misery are appointed to me When I lie down I think When will I get up But the night drags on and I toss and turn until dawn My flesh is clothed with worms and encrusted with dirt my skin is cracked and festering My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle they come to an end without hope Remember that my life is but a breath My eyes will never again see happiness The eye that beholds me will no longer see me You will look for me but I will be no more As a cloud vanishes and is gone so he who goes down to Sheol does not come back up He never returns to his house his place remembers him no more Therefore I will not restrain my mouth I will speak in the anguish of my spirit I will complain in the bitterness of my soul Am I the sea or the monster of the deep that You must keep me under guard When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint then You frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions so that I would prefer strangling and death over my life in this body I loathe my life I would not live forever Leave me alone for my days are but a breath What is man that You should exalt him that You should set Your heart upon him that You attend to him every morning and test him every moment Will You never look away from me or leave me alone to swallow my spittle If I have sinned what have I done to You O watcher of mankind Why have You made me Your target so that I am a burden to You Why do You not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity For soon I will lie down in the dust You will seek me but I will be no more”

* JOB 9:2–10:22: “Yes I know that it is so but how can a mortal be righteous before God If one wished to contend with God he could not answer Him one time out of a thousand God is wise in heart and mighty in strength Who has resisted Him and prospered He moves mountains without their knowledge and overturns them in His anger He shakes the earth from its place so that its foundations tremble He commands the sun not to shine He seals off the stars He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion of the Pleiades and the constellations of the south He does great things beyond searching out and wonders without number Were He to pass by me I would not see Him were He to move I would not recognize Him If He takes away who can stop Him Who dares to ask Him What are You doing God does not restrain His anger the helpers of Rahab cower beneath Him How then can I answer Him or choose my arguments against Him For even if I were right I could not answer I could only beg my Judge for mercy If I summoned Him and He answered me I do not believe He would listen to my voice For He would crush me with a tempest and multiply my wounds without cause He does not let me catch my breath but overwhelms me with bitterness If it is a matter of strength He is indeed mighty If it is a matter of justice who can summon Him Even if I were righteous my mouth would condemn me if I were blameless it would declare me guilty Though I am blameless I have no concern for myself I despise my own life It is all the same and so I say He destroys both the blameless and the wicked When the scourge brings sudden death He mocks the despair of the innocent The earth is given into the hand of the wicked He blindfolds its judges If it is not He then who is it My days are swifter than a runner they flee without seeing good They sweep by like boats of papyrus like an eagle swooping down on its prey If I were to say I will forget my complaint and change my expression and smile I would still dread all my sufferings I know that You will not acquit me Since I am already found guilty why should I labor in vain If I should wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye then You would plunge me into the pit and even my own clothes would despise me For He is not a man like me that I can answer Him that we can take each other to court Nor is there a mediator between us to lay his hand upon us both Let Him remove His rod from me so that His terror will no longer frighten me Then I would speak without fear of Him But as it is I am on my own I loathe my own life I will express my complaint and speak in the bitterness of my soul I will say to God Do not condemn me Let me know why You prosecute me Does it please You to oppress me to reject the work of Your hands and favor the schemes of the wicked Do You have eyes of flesh Do You see as man sees Are Your days like those of a mortal or Your years like those of a man that You should seek my iniquity and search out my sin though You know that I am not guilty and there is no deliverance from Your hand Your hands shaped me and altogether formed me Would You now turn and destroy me Please remember that You molded me like clay Would You now return me to dust Did You not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese You clothed me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews You have granted me life and loving devotion and Your care has preserved my spirit Yet You concealed these things in Your heart and I know that this was in Your mind If I sinned You would take note and would not acquit me of my iniquity If I am guilty woe to me And even if I am righteous I cannot lift my head I am full of shame and aware of my affliction Should I hold my head high You would hunt me like a lion and again display Your power against me You produce new witnesses against me and multiply Your anger toward me Hardships assault me in wave after wave Why then did You bring me from the womb Oh that I had died and no eye had seen me If only I had never come to be but had been carried from the womb to the grave Are my days not few Withdraw from me that I may have a little comfort before I go never to return to a land of darkness and gloom to a land of utter darkness of deep shadow and disorder where even the light is like darkness”

* JOB 12:2–14:22: “Truly then you are the people with whom wisdom itself will die But I also have a mind I am not inferior to you Who does not know such things as these I am a laughingstock to my friends though I called on God and He answered The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock The one at ease scorns misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping The tents of robbers are safe and those who provoke God are secure those who carry their god in their hands But ask the animals and they will instruct you ask the birds of the air and they will tell you Or speak to the earth and it will teach you let the fish of the sea inform you Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this The life of every living thing is in His hand as well as the breath of all mankind Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes its food Wisdom is found with the elderly and understanding comes with long life Wisdom and strength belong to God counsel and understanding are His What He tears down cannot be rebuilt the man He imprisons cannot be released If He holds back the waters they dry up and if He releases them they overwhelm the land True wisdom and power belong to Him The deceived and the deceiver are His He leads counselors away barefoot and makes fools of judges He loosens the bonds placed by kings and fastens a belt around their waists He leads priests away barefoot and overthrows the established He deprives the trusted of speech and takes away the discernment of elders He pours out contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into light He makes nations great and destroys them He enlarges nations then disperses them He deprives the earth’s leaders of reason and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland They grope in the darkness without light He makes them stagger like drunkards Indeed my eyes have seen all this my ears have heard and understood What you know I also know I am not inferior to you Yet I desire to speak to the Almighty and argue my case before God You however smear with lies you are all worthless physicians If only you would remain silent for that would be your wisdom Hear now my argument and listen to the plea of my lips Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf or speak deceitfully for Him Would you show Him partiality or argue in His defense Would it be well when He examined you Could you deceive Him like a man Surely He would rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality Would His majesty not terrify you Would the dread of Him not fall upon you Your maxims are proverbs of ashes your defenses are defenses of clay Be silent and I will speak Then let come to me what may Why do I put myself at risk and take my life in my own hands Though He slay me I will hope in Him I will still defend my ways to His face Moreover this will be my salvation for no godless man can appear before Him Listen carefully to my words let my declaration ring in your ears See now I have prepared my case I know that I will be vindicated Can anyone indict me If so I will be silent and die Only grant these two things to me so that I need not hide from You Withdraw Your hand from me and do not let Your terror frighten me Then call me and I will answer or let me speak and You can reply How many are my iniquities and sins Reveal to me my transgression and sin Why do You hide Your face and consider me as Your enemy Would You frighten a windblown leaf Would You chase after dry chaff For You record bitter accusations against me and bequeath to me the iniquities of my youth You put my feet in the stocks and stand watch over all my paths You set a limit for the soles of my feet So man wastes away like something rotten like a moth-eaten garment Man who is born of woman is short of days and full of trouble Like a flower he comes forth then withers away like a fleeting shadow he does not endure Do You open Your eyes to one like this Will You bring him into judgment before You Who can bring out clean from unclean No one Since his days are determined and the number of his months is with You and since You have set limits that he cannot exceed look away from him and let him rest so he can enjoy his day as a hired hand For there is hope for a tree If it is cut down it will sprout again and its tender shoots will not fail If its roots grow old in the ground and its stump dies in the soil at the scent of water it will bud and put forth twigs like a sapling But a man dies and is laid low he breathes his last and where is he As water disappears from the sea and a river becomes parched and dry so a man lies down and does not rise Until the heavens are no more he will not be awakened or roused from sleep If only You would hide me in Sheol and conceal me until Your anger has passed If only You would appoint a time for me and then remember me When a man dies will he live again All the days of my hard service I will wait until my renewal comes You will call and I will answer You will desire the work of Your hands For then You would count my steps but would not keep track of my sin My transgression would be sealed in a bag and You would cover over my iniquity But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and a rock is dislodged from its place as water wears away the stones and torrents wash away the soil so You destroy a man’s hope You forever overpower him and he passes on You change his countenance and send him away If his sons receive honor he does not know it if they are brought low he is unaware He feels only the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself”

* JOB 16:2–17:16: “I have heard many things like these miserable comforters are you all Is there no end to your long-winded speeches What provokes you to continue testifying I could also speak like you if you were in my place I could heap up words against you and shake my head at you But I would encourage you with my mouth and the consolation of my lips would bring relief Even if I speak my pain is not relieved and if I hold back how will it go away Surely He has now exhausted me You have devastated all my family You have bound me and it has become a witness my frailty rises up and testifies against me His anger has torn me and opposed me He gnashes His teeth at me My adversary pierces me with His eyes They open their mouths against me and strike my cheeks with contempt they join together against me God has delivered me to unjust men He has thrown me to the clutches of the wicked I was at ease but He shattered me He seized me by the neck and crushed me He has set me up as His target His archers surround me He pierces my kidneys without mercy and spills my gall on the ground He breaks me with wound upon wound He rushes me like a mighty warrior I have sewn sackcloth over my skin I have buried my horn in the dust My face is red with weeping and deep shadows ring my eyes yet my hands are free of violence and my prayer is pure O earth do not cover my blood may my cry for help never be laid to rest Even now my witness is in heaven and my advocate is on high My friends are my scoffers as my eyes pour out tears to God Oh that a man might plead with God as he pleads with his neighbor For when only a few years are past I will go the way of no return My spirit is broken my days are extinguished the grave awaits me Surely mockers surround me and my eyes must gaze at their rebellion Give me I pray the pledge You demand Who else will be my guarantor You have closed their minds to understanding therefore You will not exalt them If a man denounces his friends for a price the eyes of his children will fail He has made me a byword among the people a man in whose face they spit My eyes have grown dim with grief and my whole body is but a shadow The upright are appalled at this and the innocent are stirred against the godless Yet a righteous one holds to his way and the one with clean hands grows stronger But come back and try again all of you For I will not find a wise man among you My days have passed my plans are broken off even the desires of my heart They have turned night into day making light seem near in the face of darkness If I look for Sheol as my home if I spread out my bed in darkness and say to corruption You are my father and to the worm My mother or My sister where then is my hope Who can see any hope for me Will it go down to the gates of Sheol Will we go down together into the dust”

* JOB 19:2–29: “How long will you torment me and crush me with your words Ten times now you have reproached me you shamelessly mistreat me Even if I have truly gone astray my error concerns me alone If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my disgrace against me then understand that it is God who has wronged me and drawn His net around me Though I cry out Violence I get no response though I call for help there is no justice He has blocked my way so I cannot pass He has veiled my paths with darkness He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head He tears me down on every side until I am gone He uproots my hope like a tree His anger burns against me and He counts me among His enemies His troops advance together they construct a ramp against me and encamp around my tent He has removed my brothers from me my acquaintances have abandoned me My kinsmen have failed me and my friends have forgotten me My guests and maidservants count me as a stranger I am a foreigner in their sight I call for my servant but he does not answer though I implore him with my own mouth My breath is repulsive to my wife and I am loathsome to my own family Even little boys scorn me when I appear they deride me All my best friends despise me and those I love have turned against me My skin and flesh cling to my bones I have escaped by the skin of my teeth Have pity on me my friends have pity for the hand of God has struck me Why do you persecute me as God does Will you never get enough of my flesh I wish that my words were recorded and inscribed in a book by an iron stylus on lead or chiseled in stone forever But I know that my Redeemer lives and in the end He will stand upon the earth Even after my skin has been destroyed yet in my flesh I will see God I will see Him for myself my eyes will behold Him and not as a stranger How my heart yearns within me If you say Let us persecute him since the root of the matter lies with him then you should fear the sword yourselves because wrath brings punishment by the sword so that you may know”

* JOB 21:2–34: “Listen carefully to my words let this be your consolation to me Bear with me while I speak then after I have spoken you may go on mocking Is my complaint against a man Then why should I not be impatient Look at me and be appalled put your hand over your mouth When I remember terror takes hold and my body trembles in horror Why do the wicked live on growing old and increasing in power Their descendants are established around them and their offspring before their eyes Their homes are safe from fear no rod of punishment from God is upon them Their bulls breed without fail their cows bear calves and do not miscarry They send forth their little ones like a flock their children skip about singing to the tambourine and lyre and making merry at the sound of the flute They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol in peace Yet they say to God Leave us alone For we have no desire to know Your ways Who is the Almighty that we should serve Him and what would we gain if we pray to Him Still their prosperity is not in their own hands so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked How often is the lamp of the wicked put out Does disaster come upon them Does God in His anger apportion destruction Are they like straw before the wind like chaff swept away by a storm It is said that God lays up one’s punishment for his children Let God repay the man himself so he will know it Let his eyes see his own destruction let him drink for himself the wrath of the Almighty For what does he care about his household after him when the number of his months has run out Can anyone teach knowledge to God since He judges those on high One man dies full of vigor completely secure and at ease His body is well nourished and his bones are rich with marrow Yet another man dies in the bitterness of his soul having never tasted prosperity But together they lie down in the dust and worms cover them both Behold I know your thoughts full well the schemes by which you would wrong me For you say Where now is the nobleman’s house and where are the tents in which the wicked dwell Have you never asked those who travel the roads Do you not accept their reports Indeed the evil man is spared from the day of calamity delivered from the day of wrath Who denounces his behavior to his face Who repays him for what he has done He is carried to the grave and watch is kept over his tomb The clods of the valley are sweet to him everyone follows behind him and those before him are without number So how can you comfort me with empty words For your answers remain full of falsehood”

* JOB 23:2–24:25: “Even today my complaint is bitter His hand is heavy despite my groaning If only I knew where to find Him so that I could go to His seat I would plead my case before Him and fill my mouth with arguments I would learn how He would answer and consider what He would say Would He contend with me in His great power No He would certainly take note of me Then an upright man could reason with Him and I would be delivered forever from my Judge If I go east He is not there and if I go west I cannot find Him When He is at work in the north I cannot behold Him when He turns to the south I cannot see Him Yet He knows the way I have taken when He has tested me I will come forth as gold My feet have followed in His tracks I have kept His way without turning aside I have not departed from the command of His lips I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread But He is unchangeable and who can oppose Him He does what He desires For He carries out His decree against me and He has many such plans Therefore I am terrified in His presence when I consider this I fear Him God has made my heart faint the Almighty has terrified me Yet I am not silenced by the darkness by the thick darkness that covers my face Why does the Almighty not reserve times for judgment Why may those who know Him never see His days Men move boundary stones they pasture stolen flocks They drive away the donkey of the fatherless and take the widow’s ox in pledge They push the needy off the road and force all the poor of the land into hiding Indeed like wild donkeys in the desert the poor go to work foraging for food the wasteland is food for their children They gather fodder in the fields and glean the vineyards of the wicked Without clothing they spend the night naked they have no covering against the cold Drenched by mountain rains they huddle against the rocks for want of shelter The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast the nursing child of the poor is seized for a debt Without clothing they wander about naked They carry the sheaves but still go hungry They crush olives within their walls they tread the winepresses but go thirsty From the city men groan and the souls of the wounded cry out yet God charges no one with wrongdoing Then there are those who rebel against the light not knowing its ways or staying on its paths When daylight is gone the murderer rises to kill the poor and needy in the night he is like a thief The eye of the adulterer watches for twilight Thinking No eye will see me he covers his face In the dark they dig through houses by day they shut themselves in never to experience the light For to them deep darkness is their morning surely they are friends with the terrors of darkness They are but foam on the surface of the water their portion of the land is cursed so that no one turns toward their vineyards As drought and heat consume the melting snow so Sheol steals those who have sinned The womb forgets them the worm feeds on them they are remembered no more So injustice is broken like a tree They prey on the barren and childless and show no kindness to the widow Yet by His power God drags away the mighty though rising up they have no assurance of life He gives them a sense of security but His eyes are on their ways They are exalted for a moment then they are gone they are brought low and gathered up like all others they are cut off like heads of grain If this is not so then who can prove me a liar and reduce my words to nothing”

* JOB 26:2–14: “How you have helped the powerless and saved the arm that is feeble How you have counseled the unwise and provided fully sound insight To whom have you uttered these words And whose spirit spoke through you The dead tremble those beneath the waters and those who dwell in them Sheol is naked before God and Abaddon has no covering He stretches out the north over empty space He hangs the earth upon nothing He wraps up the waters in His clouds yet the clouds do not burst under their own weight He covers the face of the full moon spreading over it His cloud He has inscribed a horizon on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness The foundations of heaven quake astounded at His rebuke By His power He stirred the sea by His understanding He shattered Rahab By His breath the skies were cleared His hand pierced the fleeing serpent Indeed these are but the fringes of His ways how faint is the whisper we hear of Him Who then can understand the thunder of His power”

* JOB 27:2–28:28: “As surely as God lives who has deprived me of justice the Almighty who has embittered my soul as long as my breath is still within me and the breath of God remains in my nostrils my lips will not speak wickedness and my tongue will not utter deceit I will never say that you are right I will maintain my integrity until I die I will cling to my righteousness and never let go As long as I live my conscience will not accuse me May my enemy be like the wicked and my opponent like the unjust For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off when God takes away his life Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him Will he delight in the Almighty Will he call upon God at all times I will instruct you in the power of God I will not conceal the ways of the Almighty Surely all of you have seen it for yourselves Why then do you keep up this empty talk This is the wicked man’s portion from God the heritage the ruthless receive from the Almighty Though his sons are many they are destined for the sword and his offspring will never have enough food His survivors will be buried by the plague and their widows will not weep for them Though he heaps up silver like dust and piles up a wardrobe like clay what he lays up the righteous will wear and his silver will be divided by the innocent The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon like a hut set up by a watchman He lies down wealthy but will do so no more when he opens his eyes all is gone Terrors overtake him like a flood a tempest sweeps him away in the night The east wind carries him away and he is gone it sweeps him out of his place It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power It claps its hands at him and hisses him out of his place Surely there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined Iron is taken from the earth and copper is smelted from ore Man puts an end to the darkness he probes the farthest recesses for ore in deepest darkness Far from human habitation he cuts a shaft in places forgotten by the foot of man Far from men he dangles and sways Food may come from the earth but from below it is transformed as by fire Its rocks are the source of sapphires containing flecks of gold No bird of prey knows that path no falcon’s eye has seen it Proud beasts have never trodden it no lion has ever prowled over it The miner strikes the flint he overturns mountains at their base He hews out channels in the rocks and his eyes spot every treasure He stops up the sources of the streams to bring what is hidden to light But where can wisdom be found and where does understanding dwell No man can know its value nor is it found in the land of the living The ocean depths say It is not in me while the sea declares It is not with me It cannot be bought with gold nor can its price be weighed out in silver It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir in precious onyx or sapphire Neither gold nor crystal can compare to it nor jewels of fine gold be exchanged for it Coral and quartz are unworthy of mention the price of wisdom is beyond rubies Topaz from Cush cannot compare to it nor can it be valued in pure gold From where then does wisdom come and where does understanding dwell It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing and concealed from the birds of the air Abaddon and Death say We have heard a rumor about it But God understands its way and He knows its place For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens When God fixed the weight of the wind and measured out the waters when He set a limit for the rain and a path for the thunderbolt then He looked at wisdom and appraised it He established it and searched it out And He said to man Behold the fear of the Lord that is wisdom and to turn away from evil is understanding”

* JOB 29:2–31:40: “How I long for the months gone by for the days when God watched over me when His lamp shone above my head and by His light I walked through the darkness when I was in my prime when the friendship of God rested on my tent when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me when my steps were bathed in cream and the rock poured out for me streams of oil When I went out to the city gate and took my seat in the public square the young men saw me and withdrew and the old men rose to their feet The princes refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands The voices of the nobles were hushed and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths For those who heard me called me blessed and those who saw me commended me because I rescued the poor who cried out and the fatherless who had no helper The dying man blessed me and I made the widow’s heart sing for joy I put on righteousness and it clothed me justice was my robe and my turban I served as eyes to the blind and as feet to the lame I was a father to the needy and I took up the case of the stranger I shattered the fangs of the unjust and snatched the prey from his teeth So I thought I will die in my nest and multiply my days as the sand My roots will spread out to the waters and the dew will rest nightly on my branches My glory is ever new within me and my bow is renewed in my hand Men listened to me with expectation waiting silently for my counsel After my words they spoke no more my speech settled on them like dew They waited for me as for rain and drank in my words like spring showers If I smiled at them they did not believe it the light of my countenance was precious I chose their course and presided as chief So I dwelt as a king among his troops as a comforter of the mourners But now they mock me men younger than I am whose fathers I would have refused to put with my sheep dogs What use to me was the strength of their hands since their vigor had left them Gaunt from poverty and hunger they gnawed the dry land and the desolate wasteland by night They plucked mallow among the shrubs and the roots of the broom tree were their food They were banished from among men shouted at like thieves so that they lived on the slopes of the wadis among the rocks and in holes in the ground They cried out among the shrubs and huddled beneath the nettles A senseless and nameless brood they were driven off the land And now they mock me in song I have become a byword among them They abhor me and keep far from me they do not hesitate to spit in my face Because God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me they have cast off restraint in my presence The rabble arises at my right they lay snares for my feet and build siege ramps against me They tear up my path they profit from my destruction with no one to restrain them They advance as through a wide breach through the ruins they keep rolling in Terrors are turned loose against me they drive away my dignity as by the wind and my prosperity has passed like a cloud And now my soul is poured out within me days of affliction grip me Night pierces my bones and my gnawing pains never rest With great force He grasps my garment He seizes me by the collar of my tunic He throws me into the mud and I have become like dust and ashes I cry out to You for help but You do not answer when I stand up You merely look at me You have ruthlessly turned on me You oppose me with Your strong hand You snatch me up into the wind and drive me before it You toss me about in the storm Yes I know that You will bring me down to death to the place appointed for all the living Yet no one stretches out his hand against a ruined man when he cries for help in his distress Have I not wept for those in trouble Has my soul not grieved for the needy But when I hoped for good evil came when I looked for light darkness fell I am churning within and cannot rest days of affliction confront me I go about blackened but not by the sun I stand up in the assembly and cry for help I have become a brother of jackals a companion of ostriches My skin grows black and peels and my bones burn with fever My harp is tuned to mourning and my flute to the sound of weeping I have made a covenant with my eyes How then could I gaze with desire at a virgin For what is the allotment of God from above or the heritage from the Almighty on high Does not disaster come to the unjust and calamity to the workers of iniquity Does He not see my ways and count my every step If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has rushed to deceit let God weigh me with honest scales that He may know my integrity If my steps have turned from the path if my heart has followed my eyes or if impurity has stuck to my hands then may another eat what I have sown and may my crops be uprooted If my heart has been enticed by my neighbor’s wife or I have lurked at his door then may my own wife grind grain for another and may other men sleep with her For that would be a heinous crime an iniquity to be judged For it is a fire that burns down to Abaddon it would root out my entire harvest If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or maidservant when they made a complaint against me what will I do when God rises to judge How will I answer when called to account Did not He who made me in the womb also make them Did not the same One form us in the womb If I have denied the desires of the poor or allowed the widow’s eyes to fail if I have eaten my morsel alone not sharing it with the fatherless though from my youth I reared him as would a father and from my mother’s womb I guided the widow if I have seen one perish for lack of clothing or a needy man without a cloak if his heart has not blessed me for warming him with the fleece of my sheep if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless because I saw that I had support in the gate then may my arm fall from my shoulder and be torn from its socket For calamity from God terrifies me and His splendor I cannot overpower If I have put my trust in gold or called pure gold my security if I have rejoiced in my great wealth because my hand had gained so much if I have beheld the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth this would also be an iniquity to be judged for I would have denied God on high If I have rejoiced in my enemy’s ruin or exulted when evil befell him I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking for his life with a curse if the men of my house have not said Who is there who has not had his fill but no stranger had to lodge on the street for my door has been open to the traveler if I have covered my transgressions like Adam by hiding my guilt in my heart because I greatly feared the crowds and the contempt of the clans terrified me so that I kept silent and would not go outside Oh that I had one to hear me Here is my signature Let the Almighty answer me let my accuser compose an indictment Surely I would carry it on my shoulder and wear it like a crown I would give account of all my steps I would approach Him like a prince if my land cries out against me and its furrows weep together if I have devoured its produce without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants then let briers grow instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley”

* JOB 40:4–5: “Behold I am insignificant How can I reply to You I place my hand over my mouth I have spoken once but I have no answer twice but I have nothing to add”

* JOB 42:2–6: “I know that You can do all things and that no plan of Yours can be thwarted You asked is this who conceals My counsel without knowledge Surely I spoke of things I did not understand things too wonderful for me to know You said now and I will speak I will question you and you shall inform Me My ears had heard of You but now my eyes have seen You Therefore I despise myself and I repent in dust and ashes”
