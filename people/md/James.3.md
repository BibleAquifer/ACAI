#### NT Speeches

* JHN 21:5 (calling out): “No”

* ACT 15:13–21: “Brothers listen to me Simon has told us how God first visited the Gentiles to take from them a people to be His own The words of the prophets agree with this as it is written After this I will return and rebuild the fallen tent of David Its ruins I will rebuild and I will restore it so that the remnant of men may seek the Lord and all the Gentiles who are called by My name says the Lord who does these things that have been known for ages It is my judgment therefore that we should not cause trouble for the Gentiles who are turning to God Instead we should write and tell them to abstain from food polluted by idols from sexual immorality from the meat of strangled animals and from blood For Moses has been proclaimed in every city from ancient times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath”

* ACT 21:20–25: “You see brother how many thousands of Jews have believed and all of them are zealous for the law But they are under the impression that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to forsake Moses telling them not to circumcise their children or observe our customs What then should we do They will certainly hear that you have come Therefore do what we advise you There are four men with us who have taken a vow Take these men purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses so they can have their heads shaved Then everyone will know that there is no truth to these rumors about you but that you also live in obedience to the law As for the Gentile believers we have written to them our decision that they must abstain from food sacrificed to idols from blood from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality”
