* 1KI 18:9–14: “How have I sinned that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to put me to death As surely as the LORD your God lives there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent someone to search for you When they said He is not here he made that kingdom or nation swear that they had not found you And now you say Go tell your master that Elijah is here I do not know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you off when I leave you Then when I go and tell Ahab and he does not find you he will kill me But your servant have feared the LORD from my youth Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel slaughtered the prophets of the LORD I hid a hundred prophets of the LORD fifty men per cave and I provided them with food and water And now you say Go tell your lord that Elijah is here He will kill me”
