* JDG 9:7–20: “Listen to me O leaders of Shechem and may God listen to you One day the trees set out to anoint a king for themselves They said to the olive tree Reign over us But the olive tree replied Should I stop giving my oil that honors both God and man to hold sway over the trees Then the trees said to the fig tree Come and reign over us But the fig tree replied Should I stop giving my sweetness and my good fruit to hold sway over the trees Then the trees said to the grapevine Come and reign over us But the grapevine replied Should I stop giving my wine that cheers both God and man to hold sway over the trees Finally all the trees said to the thornbush Come and reign over us But the thornbush replied If you really are anointing me as king over you come and find refuge in my shade But if not may fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon Now if you have acted faithfully and honestly in making Abimelech king if you have done well by Jerubbaal and his family and if you have done to him as he deserves for my father fought for you and risked his life to deliver you from the hand of Midian but you have risen up against my father’s house this day and killed his seventy sons on a single stone and you have made Abimelech the son of his maidservant king over the leaders of Shechem because he is your brother if you have acted faithfully and honestly toward Jerubbaal and his house this day then may you rejoice in Abimelech and he in you But if not may fire come from Abimelech and consume the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo and may fire come from the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo and consume”
