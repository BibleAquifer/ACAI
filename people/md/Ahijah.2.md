* 1KI 11:31–39: “Take ten pieces for yourself for this is what the LORD the God of Israel says Behold I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and I will give you ten tribes But one tribe will remain for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel For they have forsaken Me to worship Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians Chemosh the god of the Moabites and Milcom the god of the Ammonites They have not walked in My ways nor done what is right in My eyes nor kept My statutes and judgments as Solomon’s father David did Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon’s hand because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David My servant whom I chose because he kept My commandments and statutes But I will take ten tribes of the kingdom from the hand of his son and give them to you I will give one tribe to his son so that My servant David will always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem the city where I chose to put My Name But as for you I will take you and you shall reign over all that your heart desires and you will be king over Israel If you listen to all that I command you walk in My ways and do what is right in My sight in order to keep My statutes and commandments as My servant David did then I will be with you I will build you a lasting dynasty just as I built for David and I will give Israel to you Because of this I will humble David’s descendants but not”

* 1KI 14:6–16: “Come in wife of Jeroboam Why are you disguised For I have been sent to you with bad news Go tell Jeroboam that this is what the LORD the God of Israel says I raised you up from among the people and appointed you ruler over My people Israel I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you But you have not been like My servant David who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart doing only what was right in My eyes You have done more evil than all who came before you You have proceeded to make for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me and you have flung Me behind your back Because of all this behold I am bringing disaster on the house of Jeroboam I will cut off from Jeroboam every male both slave and free in Israel I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns up dung until it is gone Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs and anyone who dies in the field will be eaten by the birds of the air For the LORD has spoken As for you get up and go home When your feet enter the city the child will die All Israel will mourn for him and bury him For this is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will receive a proper burial because only in him has the LORD the God of Israel found any good in the house of Jeroboam Moreover the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam This is the day even today For the LORD will strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave their fathers and He will scatter them beyond the Euphrates because they have made their Asherah poles provoking the LORD to anger So He will give Israel over on account of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit”
