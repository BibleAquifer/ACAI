#### OT Speeches

* JOB 11:2–20: “Should this stream of words go unanswered and such a speaker be vindicated Should your babbling put others to silence Will you scoff without rebuke You have said My doctrine is sound and I am pure in Your sight But if only God would speak and open His lips against you and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom for true wisdom has two sides Know then that God exacts from you less than your iniquity deserves Can you fathom the deep things of God or discover the limits of the Almighty They are higher than the heavens what can you do They are deeper than Sheol what can you know Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea If He comes along to imprison you or convenes a court who can stop Him Surely He knows the deceit of men If He sees iniquity does He not take note But a witless man can no more become wise than the colt of a wild donkey can be born a man As for you if you direct your heart and lift up your hands to Him if you put away the iniquity in your hand and allow no injustice to dwell in your tents then indeed you will lift up your face without blemish you will stand firm and unafraid For you will forget your misery recalling it only as waters gone by Your life will be brighter than noonday its darkness will be like the morning You will be secure because there is hope and you will look around and lie down in safety You will lie down without fear and many will court your favor But the eyes of the wicked will fail and escape will elude them they will hope for their last breath”

* JOB 20:2–29: “anxious thoughts compel me to answer because of the turmoil within me I have heard a rebuke that insults me and my understanding prompts a reply Do you not know that from antiquity since man was placed on the earth the triumph of the wicked has been brief and the joy of the godless momentary Though his arrogance reaches the heavens and his head touches the clouds he will perish forever like his own dung those who had seen him will ask Where is he He will fly away like a dream never to be found he will be chased away like a vision in the night The eye that saw him will see him no more and his place will no longer behold him His sons will seek the favor of the poor for his own hands must return his wealth The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie down with him in the dust Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he conceals it under his tongue though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth yet in his stomach his food sours into the venom of cobras within him He swallows wealth but vomits it out God will force it from his stomach He will suck the poison of cobras the fangs of a viper will kill him He will not enjoy the streams the rivers flowing with honey and cream He must return the fruit of his labor without consuming it he cannot enjoy the profits of his trading For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor he has seized houses he did not build Because his appetite is never satisfied he cannot escape with his treasure Nothing is left for him to consume thus his prosperity will not endure In the midst of his plenty he will be distressed the full force of misery will come upon him When he has filled his stomach God will vent His fury upon him raining it down on him as he eats Though he flees from an iron weapon a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce him It is drawn out of his back the gleaming point from his liver Terrors come over him Total darkness is reserved for his treasures A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent The heavens will expose his iniquity and the earth will rise up against him The possessions of his house will be removed flowing away on the day of God’s wrath This is the wicked man’s portion from God the inheritance God has appointed him”
