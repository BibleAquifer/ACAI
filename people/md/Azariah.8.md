* 2CH 15:2–7: “Listen to me Asa and all Judah and Benjamin The LORD is with you when you are with Him If you seek Him He will be found by you but if you forsake Him He will forsake you For many years Israel has been without the true God without a priest to instruct them and without the law But in their distress they turned to the LORD the God of Israel and sought Him and He was found by them In those days there was no safety for travelers because the residents of the lands had many conflicts Nation was crushed by nation and city by city for God afflicted them with all kinds of adversity But as for you be strong do not be discouraged for your work will be rewarded”
