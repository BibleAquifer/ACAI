* JOB 4:2–5:27: “If one ventures a word with you will you be wearied Yet who can keep from speaking Surely you have instructed many and have strengthened their feeble hands Your words have steadied those who stumbled you have braced the knees that were buckling But now trouble has come upon you and you are weary It strikes you and you are dismayed Is your reverence not your confidence and the uprightness of your ways your hope Consider now I plead Who being innocent has ever perished Or where have the upright been destroyed As I have observed those who plow iniquity and those who sow trouble reap the same By the breath of God they perish and by the blast of His anger they are consumed The lion may roar and the fierce lion may growl yet the teeth of the young lions are broken The old lion perishes for lack of prey and the cubs of the lioness are scattered Now a word came to me secretly my ears caught a whisper of it In disquieting visions in the night when deep sleep falls on men fear and trembling came over me and made all my bones shudder Then a spirit glided past my face and the hair on my body bristled It stood still but I could not discern its appearance a form loomed before my eyes and I heard a whispering voice Can a mortal be more righteous than God or a man more pure than his Maker If God puts no trust in His servants and He charges His angels with error how much more those who dwell in houses of clay whose foundations are in the dust who can be crushed like a moth They are smashed to pieces from dawn to dusk unnoticed they perish forever Are not their tent cords pulled up so that they die without wisdom Call out if you please but who will answer To which of the holy ones will you turn For resentment kills a fool and envy slays the simple I have seen a fool taking root but suddenly his house was cursed His sons are far from safety crushed in court without a defender The hungry consume his harvest taking it even from the thorns and the thirsty pant after his wealth For distress does not spring from the dust and trouble does not sprout from the ground Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward However if I were you I would appeal to God and lay my cause before Him the One who does great and unsearchable things wonders without number He gives rain to the earth and sends water upon the fields He sets the lowly on high so that mourners are lifted to safety He thwarts the schemes of the crafty so that their hands find no success He catches the wise in their craftiness and sweeps away the plans of the cunning They encounter darkness by day and grope at noon as in the night He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth and from the clutches of the powerful So the poor have hope and injustice shuts its mouth Blessed indeed is the man whom God corrects so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty For He wounds but He also binds He strikes but His hands also heal He will rescue you from six calamities no harm will touch you in seven In famine He will redeem you from death and in battle from the stroke of the sword You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue and will not fear havoc when it comes You will laugh at destruction and famine and need not fear the beasts of the earth For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field and the wild animals will be at peace with you You will know that your tent is secure and find nothing amiss when inspecting your home You will know that your offspring will be many your descendants like the grass of the earth You will come to the grave in full vigor like a sheaf of grain gathered in season Indeed we have investigated and it is true So hear it and know for yourself”

* JOB 15:2–35: “Does a wise man answer with empty counsel or fill his belly with the hot east wind Should he argue with useless words or speeches that serve no purpose But you even undermine the fear of God and hinder meditation before Him For your iniquity instructs your mouth and you choose the language of the crafty Your own mouth not mine condemns you your own lips testify against you Were you the first man ever born Were you brought forth before the hills Do you listen in on the council of God or limit wisdom to yourself What do you know that we do not What do you understand that is not clear to us Both the gray-haired and the aged are on our side men much older than your father Are the consolations of God not enough for you even words spoken gently to you Why has your heart carried you away and why do your eyes flash so that you turn your spirit against God and pour such words from your mouth What is man that he should be pure or one born of woman that he should be righteous If God puts no trust in His holy ones if even the heavens are not pure in His eyes how much less man who is vile and corrupt who drinks injustice like water Listen to me and I will inform you I will describe what I have seen what was declared by wise men and was not concealed from their fathers to whom alone the land was given when no foreigner passed among them A wicked man writhes in pain all his days only a few years are reserved for the ruthless Sounds of terror fill his ears in his prosperity the destroyer attacks him He despairs of his return from darkness he is marked for the sword He wanders about as food for vultures he knows the day of darkness is at hand Distress and anguish terrify him overwhelming him like a king poised to attack For he has stretched out his hand against God and has vaunted himself against the Almighty rushing headlong at Him with a thick studded shield Though his face is covered with fat and his waistline bulges with flesh he will dwell in ruined cities in abandoned houses destined to become rubble He will no longer be rich his wealth will not endure His possessions will not overspread the land He will not escape from the darkness the flame will wither his shoots and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away Let him not deceive himself with trust in emptiness for emptiness will be his reward It will be paid in full before his time and his branch will not flourish He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes like an olive tree that sheds its blossoms For the company of the godless will be barren and fire will consume the tents of bribery They conceive trouble and give birth to evil their womb is pregnant with deceit”

* JOB 22:2–30: “Can a man be of use to God Can even a wise man benefit Him Does it delight the Almighty that you are righteous Does He profit if your ways are blameless Is it for your reverence that He rebukes you and enters into judgment against you Is not your wickedness great Are not your iniquities endless For you needlessly demanded security from your brothers and deprived the naked of their clothing You gave no water to the weary and withheld food from the famished while the land belonged to a mighty man and a man of honor lived on it You sent widows away empty-handed and the strength of the fatherless was crushed Therefore snares surround you and sudden peril terrifies you it is so dark you cannot see and a flood of water covers you Is not God as high as the heavens Look at the highest stars how lofty they are Yet you say What does God know Does He judge through thick darkness Thick clouds veil Him so He does not see us as He traverses the vault of heaven Will you stay on the ancient path that wicked men have trod They were snatched away before their time and their foundations were swept away by a flood They said to God Depart from us What can the Almighty do to us But it was He who filled their houses with good things so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked The righteous see it and are glad the innocent mock them Surely our foes are destroyed and fire has consumed their excess Reconcile now and be at peace with Him thereby good will come to you Receive instruction from His mouth and lay up His words in your heart If you return to the Almighty you will be restored If you remove injustice from your tents and consign your gold to the dust and the gold of Ophir to the stones of the ravines then the Almighty will be your gold and the finest silver for you Surely then you will delight in the Almighty and lift up your face to God You will pray to Him and He will hear you and you will fulfill your vows Your decisions will be carried out and light will shine on your ways When men are brought low and you say Lift them up then He will save the lowly He will deliver even one who is not innocent rescuing him through the cleanness of your hands”
