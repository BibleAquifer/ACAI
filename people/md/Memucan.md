* EST 1:16–20: “Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king but all the princes and the peoples in all the provinces of King Xerxes For the conduct of the queen will become known to all women causing them to despise their husbands and say King Xerxes ordered Queen Vashti to be brought before him but she did not come This very day the noble women of Persia and Media who have heard about the queen’s conduct will say the same thing to all the king’s officials resulting in much contempt and wrath So if it pleases the king let him issue a royal decree and let it be recorded in the laws of Persia and Media so that it cannot be repealed that Vashti shall never again enter the presence of King Xerxes and that her royal position shall be given to a woman better than she The edict the king issues will be heard throughout his vast kingdom and so all women from the least to the greatest will honor their husbands”
