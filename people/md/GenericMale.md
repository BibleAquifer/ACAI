* DAN 10:19: “Speak my lord for you have strengthened me”

* DAN 10:20–12:4: “Do you know why I have come to you I must return at once to fight against the prince of Persia and when I have gone forth behold the prince of Greece will come But first I will tell you what is inscribed in the Book of Truth Yet no one has the courage to support me against these except Michael your prince And I in the first year of Darius the Mede stood up to strengthen and protect him Now then I will tell you the truth Three more kings will arise in Persia and then a fourth who will be far richer than all the others By the power of his wealth he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece Then a mighty king will arise who will rule with great authority and do as he pleases But as soon as he is established his kingdom will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven It will not go to his descendants nor will it have the authority with which he ruled because his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others The king of the South will grow strong but one of his commanders will grow even stronger and will rule his own kingdom with great authority After some years they will form an alliance and the daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to seal the agreement But his daughter will not retain her position of power nor will his strength endure At that time she will be given up along with her royal escort and her father and the one who supported her But one from her family line will rise up in his place come against the army of the king of the North and enter his fortress fighting and prevailing He will take even their gods captive to Egypt with their metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold For some years he will stay away from the king of the North who will invade the realm of the king of the South and then return to his own land But his sons will stir up strife and assemble a great army which will advance forcefully sweeping through like a flood and will again carry the battle as far as his fortress In a rage the king of the South will march out to fight the king of the North who will raise a large army but it will be delivered into the hand of his enemy When the army is carried off the king of the South will be proud in heart and will cast down tens of thousands but he will not triumph For the king of the North will raise another army larger than the first and after some years he will advance with a great army and many supplies In those times many will rise up against the king of the South Violent ones among your own people will exalt themselves in fulfillment of the vision but they will fail Then the king of the North will come build up a siege ramp and capture a fortified city The forces of the South will not stand even their best troops will not be able to resist The invader will do as he pleases and no one will stand against him He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land with destruction in his hand He will resolve to come with the strength of his whole kingdom and will reach an agreement with the king of the South He will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom but his plan will not succeed or help him Then he will turn his face to the coastlands and capture many of them But a commander will put an end to his reproach and will turn it back upon him After this he will turn back toward the fortresses of his own land but he will stumble and fall and be no more In his place one will arise who will send out a tax collector for the glory of the kingdom but within a few days he will be destroyed though not in anger or in battle In his place a despicable person will arise royal honors will not be given to him but he will come in a time of peace and seize the kingdom by intrigue Then a flood of forces will be swept away before him and destroyed along with a prince of the covenant After an alliance is made with him he will act deceitfully for he will rise to power with only a few people In a time of peace he will invade the richest provinces and do what his fathers and forefathers never did He will lavish plunder loot and wealth on his followers and he will plot against the strongholds but only for a time And with a large army he will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South who will mobilize a very large and powerful army but will not withstand the plots devised against him Those who eat from his provisions will seek to destroy him his army will be swept away and many will fall slain And the two kings with their hearts bent on evil will speak lies at the same table but to no avail for still the end will come at the appointed time The king of the North will return to his land with great wealth but his heart will be set against the holy covenant so he will do damage and return to his own land At the appointed time he will invade the South again but this time will not be like the first Ships of Kittim will come against him and he will lose heart Then he will turn back and rage against the holy covenant and do damage So he will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant His forces will rise up and desecrate the temple fortress They will abolish the daily sacrifice and set up the abomination of desolation With flattery he will corrupt those who violate the covenant but the people who know their God will firmly resist him Those with insight will instruct many though for a time they will fall by sword or flame or be captured or plundered Now when they fall they will be granted a little help but many will join them insincerely Some of the wise will fall so that they may be refined purified and made spotless until the time of the end for it will still come at the appointed time Then the king will do as he pleases and will exalt and magnify himself above every god and he will speak monstrous things against the God of gods He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed for what has been decreed must be accomplished He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers nor for the one desired by women nor for any other god because he will magnify himself above them all And in their place he will honor a god of fortresses a god his fathers did not know with gold silver precious stones and riches He will attack the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him making them rulers over many and distributing the land for a price At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him in battle but the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots horsemen and many ships invading many countries and sweeping through them like a flood He will also invade the Beautiful Land and many countries will fall But these will be delivered from his hand Edom Moab and the leaders of the Ammonites He will extend his power over many countries and not even the land of Egypt will escape He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and over all the riches of Egypt and the Libyans and Cushites will also submit to him But news from the east and the north will alarm him and he will go out with great fury to destroy many and devote them to destruction He will pitch his royal tents between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain but he will meet his end with no one to help him At that time Michael the great prince who stands watch over your people will rise up There will be a time of distress the likes of which will not have occurred from the beginning of nations until that time But at that time your people everyone whose name is found written in the book will be delivered And many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake some to everlasting life but others to shame and everlasting contempt Then the wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever and ever But you Daniel shut up these words and seal the book until the time of the end Many will roam to and fro and knowledge will increase”

* DAN 12:9–13: “Go on your way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end Many will be purified made spotless and refined but the wicked will continue to act wickedly None of the wicked will understand but the wise will understand And from the time the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation set up there will be 1,290 days Blessed is he who waits and reaches the end of the 1,335 days But as for you go on your way until the end You will rest and then you will arise to your inheritance at the end of the days”

* JOL 4:10: “I am strong”

* HAB 2:19: “Woe to him who says to wood Awake or to silent stone Arise Can it give guidance Behold it is overlaid with gold and silver yet there is no breath in it at all”

* ZEC 2:6: “Where are you going”

* ZEC 2:6: “To measure Jerusalem and to determine its width and length”
