#### OT Speeches

* NUM 32:3–4: “Ataroth Dibon Jazer Nimrah Heshbon Elealeh Sebam Nebo and Beon which the LORD conquered before the congregation of Israel are suitable for livestock servants have livestock”

* NUM 32:5: “If we have found favor in your sight let this land be given to your servants as a possession Do not make us cross the Jordan”

* NUM 32:16–19: “We want to build sheepfolds here for our livestock and cities for our little ones But we will arm ourselves and be ready to go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them into their place Meanwhile our little ones will remain in the fortified cities for protection from the inhabitants of the land We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has taken possession of his inheritance Yet we will not have an inheritance with them across the Jordan and beyond because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan”

* NUM 32:25–27: “Your servants will do just as our lord commands Our children our wives our livestock and all our animals will remain here in the cities of Gilead But your servants are equipped for war and every man will cross over to the battle before the LORD just as our lord says”

* NUM 32:31–32: “As the LORD has spoken to your servants so we will do We will cross over into the land of Canaan armed before the LORD that we may have our inheritance on this side of the Jordan”

* JOS 1:16–18: “Everything you have commanded us we will do and everywhere you send us we will go Just as we obeyed Moses in all things so we will obey you And may the LORD your God be with you as He was with Moses Anyone who rebels against your order and does not obey your words all that you command him will be put to death Above all be strong and courageous”

* JOS 22:22–29: “The LORD the Mighty One is God The LORD the Mighty One is God He knows and may Israel also know If this was in rebellion or breach of faith against the LORD do not spare us today If we have built for ourselves an altar to turn away from Him and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings on it or to sacrifice peace offerings on it may the LORD Himself hold us accountable But in fact we have done this for fear that in the future your descendants might say to ours What have you to do with the LORD the God of Israel For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you Reubenites and Gadites You have no share in the LORD So your descendants could cause ours to stop fearing the LORD That is why we said Let us take action and build an altar for ourselves but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices Rather let it be a witness between us and you and the generations to come that we will worship the LORD in His presence with our burnt offerings sacrifices and peace offerings Then in the future your descendants cannot say to ours You have no share in the LORD Therefore we said If they ever say this to us or to our descendants we will answer Look at the replica of the altar of the LORD that our fathers made not for burnt offerings or sacrifices but as a witness between us and you Far be it from us to rebel against the LORD and turn away from Him today by building an altar for burnt offerings grain offerings or sacrifices other than the altar of the LORD our God which stands before His tabernacle”
