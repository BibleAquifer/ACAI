* JER 35:6–11: “We do not drink wine for our forefather Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us Neither you nor your descendants are ever to drink wine Nor are you ever to build a house or sow seed or plant a vineyard Those things are not for you Instead you must live in tents all your lives so that you may live a long time in the land where you wander And we have obeyed the voice of our forefather Jonadab son of Rechab in all he commanded us So we have not drunk wine all our lives neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters Nor have we built houses in which to live and we have not owned any vineyards or fields or crops But we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done exactly as our forefather Jonadab commanded us So when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched into the land we said Come let us go into Jerusalem to escape the armies of the Chaldeans and the Arameans So we have remained in Jerusalem”
