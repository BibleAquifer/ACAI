* DAN 8:17: “of man he that the vision concerns the time of the end”

* DAN 8:19–26: “Behold I will make known to you what will happen in the latter time of wrath because it concerns the appointed time of the end The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia The shaggy goat represents the king of Greece and the large horn between his eyes is the first king The four horns that replaced the broken one represent four kingdoms that will rise from that nation but will not have the same power In the latter part of their reign when the rebellion has reached its full measure an insolent king skilled in intrigue will come to the throne His power will be great but it will not be his own He will cause terrible destruction and succeed in whatever he does He will destroy the mighty men along with the holy people Through his craft and by his hand he will cause deceit to prosper and in his own mind he will make himself great In a time of peace he will destroy many and he will even stand against the Prince of princes Yet he will be broken off but not by human hands The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been spoken is true Now you must seal up the vision for it concerns the distant future”

* DAN 9:22–27: “O Daniel I have come now to give you insight and understanding At the beginning of your petitions an answer went out and I have come to tell you for you are highly precious So consider the message and understand the vision Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city to stop their transgression to put an end to sin to make atonement for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the Most Holy Place Know and understand this From the issuance of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Messiah the Prince there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench but in times of distress Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing Then the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary The end will come like a flood and until the end there will be war desolations have been decreed And he will confirm a covenant with many for one week but in the middle of the week he will put an end to sacrifice and offering And on the wing of the temple will come the abomination that causes desolation until the decreed destruction is poured out upon him”
