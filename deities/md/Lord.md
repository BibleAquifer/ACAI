free then his master is to bring him before the judges And he shall take him to the door or doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl Then he shall serve his master for life And if a man sells his daughter as a servant she is not to go free as the menservants do If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who had designated her for himself he must allow her to be redeemed He has no right to sell her to foreigners since he has broken faith with her And if he chooses her for his son he must deal with her as with a daughter If he takes another wife he must not reduce the food clothing or marital rights of his first wife If however he does not provide her with these three things she is free to go without monetary payment Whoever strikes and kills a man must surely be put to death If

completely healed If a man strikes his manservant or maidservant with a rod and the servant dies by his hand he shall surely be punished However if the servant gets up after a day or two the owner shall not be punished since the servant is his property If men who are fighting strike a pregnant woman and her child is born prematurely but there is no further injury he shall surely be fined as the woman’s husband demands and as the court allows But if a serious injury results then you must require a life for a life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burn for burn wound for

manservant or maidservant he must let the servant go free as compensation for the tooth If an ox gores a man or woman to death the ox must surely be stoned and its meat must not be eaten But the owner of the ox shall not be held responsible But if the ox has a habit of goring and its owner has been warned yet does not restrain it and it kills a man or woman then the ox must be stoned and its owner must also be put to death If payment is demanded of him instead he may redeem his life by paying the full amount demanded of him If the ox gores a son or a daughter it shall be done to him according to the same rule If the ox gores a manservant or maidservant the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the master of that servant and the ox must be stoned If a man opens or digs a pit and fails to cover it and an ox or a donkey falls into it the owner of the pit shall make restitution he must pay its owner and the dead animal will be his If a man’s ox injures his neighbor’s ox and it dies

compensation ox for ox and the dead animal will be his If a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters or sells it he must repay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep If a thief is caught breaking in and is beaten to death no one shall be guilty of bloodshed But if it happens after sunrise there is guilt for his bloodshed A thief must make full restitution if he has nothing he himself

house the thief if caught must pay back double If the thief is not found the owner of the house must appear before the judges to determine whether he has taken his neighbor’s property In all cases of illegal possession of an ox a donkey a sheep a garment or any lost item that someone claims This is mine both parties shall bring their cases before the judges The one whom the judges find guilty must pay back double to his neighbor If a man gives a donkey an ox a sheep or any other animal to be cared for by his neighbor but it dies or is injured or stolen while no one is watching an oath before the LORD shall be made between the parties to determine whether or not the man has taken his neighbor’s property The owner must accept the oath and require no restitution But if the animal was actually stolen from the neighbor he must make restitution to the owner If the animal was torn to pieces he shall bring it as evidence he need not make restitution for the torn carcass If a man borrows an animal from his neighbor and it is injured or dies while its owner is not present he must make full restitution If the owner was present no restitution is required If the animal was rented

him the man still must pay an amount comparable to the bridal price of a virgin You must not allow a sorceress to live Whoever lies with an animal must surely be put to death If anyone sacrifices to any god other than the LORD alone he must be set apart for destruction You must not exploit or oppress a foreign resident for you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt You must not mistreat any widow or orphan If you do mistreat them and they cry out to Me in distress I will surely hear their cry My anger will be kindled and I will kill you with the sword then your wives will become

foreign resident since you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt For six years you are to sow your land and gather its produce but in the seventh year you must let it rest and lie fallow so that the poor among your people may eat from the field and the wild animals may consume what they leave Do the same with your vineyard and olive grove For six days you are to do your work but on the seventh day you must cease so that your ox and your donkey may rest and the son of your maidservant may be refreshed as well as the foreign resident Pay

the Feast of Unleavened Bread as I commanded you At the appointed time in the month of Abib you are to eat unleavened bread for seven days because that was the month you came out of Egypt No one may appear before Me empty-handed You are also to keep the Feast of Harvest with the firstfruits of the produce from what you sow in the field And keep the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year when

* LEV 4:2–5:13: “Tell the Israelites to do as follows with one who sins unintentionally against any of the LORD’s commandments and does what is forbidden by them If the anointed priest sins bringing guilt on the people he must bring to the LORD a young bull without blemish as a sin offering for the sin he has committed He must bring the bull to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD lay his hand on the bull’s head and slaughter it before the LORD Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood and bring it into the Tent of Meeting The priest is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the LORD in front of the veil of the sanctuary The priest must then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting And he is to pour out the rest of the bull’s blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting Then he shall remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering the fat that covers the entrails all the fat that is on them both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins and the lobe of the liver which he is to remove with the kidneys just as the fat is removed from the ox of the peace offering Then the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering But the hide of the bull and all its flesh with its head and legs and its entrails and dung all the rest of the bull he must take outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place where the ashes are poured out and there he must burn it on a wood fire on the ash heap Now if the whole congregation of Israel strays unintentionally and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly so that they violate any of the LORD’s commandments and incur guilt by doing what is forbidden when they become aware of the sin they have committed then the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin offering and present it before the Tent of Meeting The elders of the congregation are to lay their hands on the bull’s head before the LORD and it shall be slaughtered before the LORD Then the anointed priest is to bring some of the bull’s blood into the Tent of Meeting and he is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD in front of the veil He is also to put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting and he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting And he is to remove all the fat from it and burn it on the altar He shall offer this bull just as he did the bull for the sin offering in this way the priest will make atonement on their behalf and they will be forgiven Then he is to take the bull outside the camp and burn it just as he burned the first bull It is the sin offering for the assembly When a leader sins unintentionally and does what is prohibited by any of the commandments of the LORD his God he incurs guilt When he becomes aware of the sin he has committed he must bring an unblemished male goat as his offering He is to lay his hand on the head of the goat and slaughter it at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the LORD It is a sin offering Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar He must burn all its fat on the altar like the fat of the peace offerings thus the priest will make atonement for that man’s sin and he will be forgiven And if one of the common people sins unintentionally and does what is prohibited by any of the LORD’s commandments he incurs guilt When he becomes aware of the sin he has committed he must bring an unblemished female goat as his offering for that sin He is to lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering Then the priest is to take some of its blood with his finger put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar Then he is to remove all the fat just as it is removed from the peace offering and the priest is to burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the LORD In this way the priest will make atonement for him and he will be forgiven If however he brings a lamb as a sin offering he must bring an unblemished female And he is to lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it as a sin offering at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar And he shall remove all the fat just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the peace offerings and he shall burn it on the altar along with the food offerings to the LORD In this way the priest will make atonement for him for the sin he has committed and he will be forgiven If someone sins by failing to testify when he hears a public charge about something he has witnessed whether he has seen it or learned of it he shall bear the iniquity Or if a person touches anything unclean whether the carcass of any unclean wild animal or livestock or crawling creature even if he is unaware of it he is unclean and guilty Or if he touches human uncleanness anything by which one becomes unclean even if he is unaware of it when he realizes it he is guilty Or if someone swears thoughtlessly with his lips to do anything good or evil in whatever matter a man may rashly pronounce an oath even if he is unaware of it when he realizes it he is guilty in the matter If someone incurs guilt in one of these ways he must confess the sin he has committed and he must bring his guilt offering to the LORD for the sin he has committed a female lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering And the priest will make atonement for him concerning his sin If however he cannot afford a lamb he may bring to the LORD as restitution for his sin two turtledoves or two young pigeons one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering He is to bring them to the priest who shall first present the one for the sin offering He is to twist its head at the front of its neck without severing it then he is to sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar while the rest of the blood is drained out at the base of the altar It is a sin offering And the priest must prepare the second bird as a burnt offering according to the ordinance In this way the priest will make atonement for him for the sin he has committed and he will be forgiven But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons he may bring a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering He must not put olive oil or frankincense on it because it is a sin offering He is to bring it to the priest who shall take a handful from it as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar atop the food offerings to the LORD it is a sin offering In this way the priest will make atonement for him for any of these sins he has committed and he will be forgiven The remainder will belong to the priest like the grain offering”

presents the bull for his sin offering and makes atonement for himself and his household he is to slaughter the bull for his own sin offering Then he must take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the LORD and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense and take them inside the veil He is to put the incense on the fire before the LORD and the cloud of incense will cover the mercy seat above the Testimony so that he will not die And he is to take some of the bull’s blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the east side of the mercy seat then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the mercy seat Aaron shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and bring its blood behind the veil and with its blood he must do as he did with the bull’s blood He is to sprinkle it against the mercy seat and in front of it So he shall make atonement for the Most Holy Place because of the impurities and rebellious acts of the Israelites

make atonement in the Most Holy Place until he leaves after he has made atonement for himself his household and the whole assembly of Israel Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it He is to take some of the bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood and put it on all the horns of the altar He is to sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse it and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites When Aaron has finished purifying the Most Holy Place the Tent of Meeting and the altar he is to bring forward the live goat Then he is to lay both hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities and rebellious acts of the Israelites in regard to all their sins He is to put them on the goat’s head and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man appointed for the task The goat will carry on itself all their iniquities into a solitary place and the man will release it into the wilderness Then Aaron is to enter the Tent of Meeting take off the linen garments he put on before entering the Most Holy Place and leave them there He is to bathe himself with water in a holy place and put on his own clothes Then he must go out and sacrifice his burnt offering and the people’s burnt offering to make atonement for himself and for the people He is also to burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar The man who released the goat as the scapegoat must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water afterward he may reenter the camp The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to make atonement must be taken outside the camp and their hides flesh and dung must be burned up The one who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water and afterward he may reenter the camp This is to be a permanent statute for you On the tenth day of the seventh month you shall humble yourselves and not do any

* LEV 25:2–26:45: “Speak to the Israelites and say to them When you enter the land that I am giving you the land itself must observe a Sabbath to the LORD For six years you may sow your field and prune your vineyard and gather its crops But in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of complete rest for the land a Sabbath to the LORD You are not to sow your field or prune your vineyard You are not to reap the aftergrowth of your harvest or gather the grapes of your untended vines The land must have a year of complete rest Whatever the land yields during the Sabbath year shall be food for you for yourself your manservant and maidservant the hired hand or foreigner who stays with you and for your livestock and the wild animals in your land All its growth may serve as food And you shall count off seven Sabbaths of years seven times seven years so that the seven Sabbaths of years amount to forty-nine years Then you are to sound the horn far and wide on the tenth day of the seventh month the Day of Atonement You shall sound it throughout your land So you are to consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty in the land for all its inhabitants It shall be your Jubilee when each of you is to return to his property and to his clan The fiftieth year will be a Jubilee for you you are not to sow the land or reap its aftergrowth or harvest the untended vines For it is a Jubilee it shall be holy to you You may eat only the crops taken directly from the field In this Year of Jubilee each of you shall return to his own property If you make a sale to your neighbor or a purchase from him you must not take advantage of each other You are to buy from your neighbor according to the number of years since the last Jubilee he is to sell to you according to the number of harvest years remaining You shall increase the price in proportion to a greater number of years or decrease it in proportion to a lesser number of years for he is selling you a given number of harvests Do not take advantage of each other but fear your God for I am the LORD your God You are to keep My statutes and carefully observe My judgments so that you may dwell securely in the land Then the land will yield its fruit so that you can eat your fill and dwell in safety in the land Now you may wonder What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not sow or gather our produce But I will send My blessing upon you in the sixth year so that the land will yield a crop sufficient for three years While you are sowing in the eighth year you will be eating from the previous harvest until the ninth year’s harvest comes in The land must not be sold permanently because it is Mine and you are but foreigners and residents with Me Thus for every piece of property you possess you must provide for the redemption of the land If your brother becomes impoverished and sells some of his property his nearest of kin may come and redeem what his brother has sold Or if a man has no one to redeem it for him but he prospers and acquires enough to redeem his land he shall calculate the years since its sale repay the balance to the man to whom he sold it and return to his property But if he cannot obtain enough to repay him what he sold will remain in possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee In the Jubilee however it is to be released so that he may return to his property If a man sells a house in a walled city he retains his right of redemption until a full year after its sale during that year it may be redeemed If it is not redeemed by the end of a full year then the house in the walled city is permanently transferred to its buyer and his descendants It is not to be released in the Jubilee But houses in villages with no walls around them are to be considered as open fields They may be redeemed and they shall be released in the Jubilee As for the cities of the Levites the Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the cities they possess So whatever belongs to the Levites may be redeemed a house sold in a city they possess and must be released in the Jubilee because the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the Israelites But the open pastureland around their cities may not be sold for this is their permanent possession Now if your countryman becomes destitute and cannot support himself among you then you are to help him as you would a foreigner or stranger so that he can continue to live among you Do not take any interest or profit from him but fear your God that your countryman may live among you You must not lend him your silver at interest or sell him your food for profit I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God If a countryman among you becomes destitute and sells himself to you then you must not force him into slave labor Let him stay with you as a hired worker or temporary resident he is to work for you until the Year of Jubilee Then he and his children are to be released and he may return to his clan and to the property of his fathers Because the Israelites are My servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt they are not to be sold as slaves You are not to rule over them harshly but you shall fear your God Your menservants and maidservants shall come from the nations around you from whom you may purchase them You may also purchase them from the foreigners residing among you or their clans living among you who are born in your land These may become your property You may leave them to your sons after you to inherit as property you can make them slaves for life But as for your brothers the Israelites no man may rule harshly over his brother If a foreigner residing among you prospers but your countryman dwelling near him becomes destitute and sells himself to the foreigner or to a member of his clan he retains the right of redemption after he has sold himself One of his brothers may redeem him either his uncle or cousin or any close relative from his clan may redeem him Or if he prospers he may redeem himself He and his purchaser will then count the time from the year he sold himself up to the Year of Jubilee The price of his sale will be determined by the number of years based on the daily wages of a hired hand If many years remain he must pay for his redemption in proportion to his purchase price If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee he is to calculate and pay his redemption according to his remaining years He shall be treated like a man hired from year to year but a foreign owner must not rule over him harshly in your sight Even if he is not redeemed in any of these ways he and his children shall be released in the Year of Jubilee For the Israelites are My servants They are My servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt I am the LORD your God You must not make idols for yourselves or set up a carved image or sacred pillar you must not place a sculpted stone in your land to bow down to it For I am the LORD your God You must keep My Sabbaths and have reverence for My sanctuary I am the LORD If you follow My statutes and carefully keep My commandments I will give you rains in their season and the land will yield its produce and the trees of the field will bear their fruit Your threshing will continue until the grape harvest and the grape harvest will continue until sowing time you will have your fill of food to eat and will dwell securely in your land And I will give peace to the land and you will lie down with nothing to fear I will rid the land of dangerous animals and no sword will pass through your land You will pursue your enemies and they will fall by the sword before you Five of you will pursue a hundred and a hundred of you will pursue ten thousand and your enemies will fall by the sword before you I will turn toward you and make you fruitful and multiply you and I will establish My covenant with you You will still be eating the old supply of grain when you need to clear it out to make room for the new And I will make My dwelling place among you and My soul will not despise you I will walk among you and be your God and you will be My people I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves to the Egyptians I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk in uprightness If however you fail to obey Me and to carry out all these commandments and if you reject My statutes despise My ordinances and neglect to carry out all My commandments and so break My covenant then this is what I will do to you I will bring upon you sudden terror wasting disease and fever that will destroy your sight and drain your life You will sow your seed in vain because your enemies will eat it And I will set My face against you so that you will be defeated by your enemies Those who hate you will rule over you and you will flee when no one pursues you And if after all this you will not obey Me I will proceed to punish you sevenfold for your sins I will break down your stubborn pride and make your sky like iron and your land like bronze and your strength will be spent in vain For your land will not yield its produce and the trees of the land will not bear their fruit If you walk in hostility toward Me and refuse to obey Me I will multiply your plagues seven times according to your sins I will send wild animals against you to rob you of your children destroy your livestock and reduce your numbers until your roads lie desolate And if in spite of these things you do not accept My discipline but continue to walk in hostility toward Me then I will act with hostility toward you and I will strike you sevenfold for your sins And I will bring a sword against you to execute the vengeance of the covenant Though you withdraw into your cities I will send a plague among you and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy When I cut off your supply of bread ten women will bake your bread in a single oven and dole out your bread by weight so that you will eat but not be satisfied But if in spite of all this you do not obey Me but continue to walk in hostility toward Me then I will walk in fury against you and I even I will punish you sevenfold for your sins You will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters I will destroy your high places cut down your incense altars and heap your lifeless bodies on the lifeless remains of your idols and My soul will despise you I will reduce your cities to rubble and lay waste your sanctuaries and I will refuse to smell the pleasing aroma of your sacrifices And I will lay waste the land so that your enemies who dwell in it will be appalled But I will scatter you among the nations and will draw out a sword after you as your land becomes desolate and your cities are laid waste Then the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths all the days it lies desolate while you are in the land of your enemies At that time the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths As long as it lies desolate the land will have the rest it did not receive during the Sabbaths when you lived in it As for those of you who survive I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies so that even the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight And they will flee as one flees the sword and fall when no one pursues them They will stumble over one another as before the sword though no one is behind them So you will not be able to stand against your enemies You will perish among the nations and the land of your enemies will consume you Those of you who survive in the lands of your enemies will waste away in their iniquity and will decay in the sins of their fathers But if they will confess their iniquity and that of their fathers in the unfaithfulness that they practiced against Me by which they have also walked in hostility toward Me and I acted with hostility toward them and brought them into the land of their enemies and if their uncircumcised hearts will be humbled and they will make amends for their iniquity then I will remember My covenant with Jacob and My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with Abraham and I will remember the land For the land will be abandoned by them and it will enjoy its Sabbaths by lying desolate without them And they will pay the penalty for their iniquity because they rejected My ordinances and abhorred My statutes Yet in spite of this when they are in the land of their enemies I will not reject or despise them so as to destroy them and break My covenant with them for I am the LORD their God But for their sake I will remember the covenant with their fathers whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations that I might be their God I am the LORD”

* LEV 27:2–33: “Speak to the Israelites and say to them When someone makes a special vow to the LORD involving the value of persons if the valuation concerns a male from twenty to sixty years of age then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver according to the sanctuary shekel Or if it is a female then your valuation shall be thirty shekels And if the person is from five to twenty years of age then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels Now if the person is from one month to five years of age then your valuation for the male shall be five shekels of silver and for the female three shekels of silver And if the person is sixty years of age or older then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels for the male and ten shekels for the female But if the one making the vow is too poor to pay the valuation he is to present the person before the priest who shall set the value according to what the one making the vow can afford If he vows an animal that may be brought as an offering to the LORD any such animal given to the LORD shall be holy He must not replace it or exchange it either good for bad or bad for good But if he does substitute one animal for another both that animal and its substitute will be holy But if the vow involves any of the unclean animals that may not be brought as an offering to the LORD the animal must be presented before the priest The priest shall set its value whether high or low as the priest values it the price will be set If the owner decides to redeem the animal he must add a fifth to its value Now if a man consecrates his house as holy to the LORD then the priest shall value it either as good or bad The price will stand just as the priest values it But if he who consecrated his house redeems it he must add a fifth to the assessed value and it will belong to him If a man consecrates to the LORD a parcel of his land then your valuation shall be proportional to the seed required for it fifty shekels of silver for every homer of barley seed If he consecrates his field during the Year of Jubilee the price will stand according to your valuation But if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee the priest is to calculate the price in proportion to the years left until the next Year of Jubilee so that your valuation will be reduced And if the one who consecrated the field decides to redeem it he must add a fifth to the assessed value and it shall belong to him If however he does not redeem the field or if he has sold it to another man it may no longer be redeemed When the field is released in the Jubilee it will become holy like a field devoted to the LORD it becomes the property of the priests Now if a man consecrates to the LORD a field he has purchased which is not a part of his own property then the priest shall calculate for him the value up to the Year of Jubilee and the man shall pay the assessed value on that day as a sacred offering to the LORD In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought the original owner of the land Every valuation will be according to the sanctuary shekel twenty gerahs to the shekel But no one may consecrate a firstborn of the livestock because a firstborn belongs to the LORD Whether it is an ox or a sheep it is the LORD’s But if it is among the unclean animals then he may redeem it according to your valuation and add a fifth of its value If it is not redeemed then it shall be sold according to your valuation Nothing that a man sets apart to the LORD from all he owns whether a man an animal or his inherited land can be sold everything so devoted is most holy to the LORD No person set apart for destruction may be ransomed he must surely be put to death Thus any tithe from the land whether from the seed of the land or the fruit of the trees belongs to the LORD it is holy to the LORD If a man wishes to redeem part of his tithe he must add a fifth to its value Every tenth animal from the herd or flock that passes under the shepherd’s rod will be holy to the LORD He must not inspect whether it is good or bad and he shall not make any substitution But if he does make a substitution both the animal and its substitute shall become holy they cannot be redeemed”

of the earth Tell Me if you have understanding Who fixed its measurements Surely you know Or who stretched a measuring line across it On what were its foundations set or who laid its cornerstone while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy Who enclosed the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb when I made the clouds its garment and thick darkness its blanket when I fixed its boundaries and set in place its bars and doors and I declared You may come this far but no farther here your proud waves must stop In your days have you commanded the morning or assigned the dawn its place that it might spread to the ends of the earth and shake the wicked out of it The earth takes shape like clay under a seal its hills stand out like the folds of a garment Light is withheld from the wicked and their upraised arm is broken Have you journeyed to the vents of the sea or walked in the trenches of the deep Have the gates of death been revealed to you Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death Have you surveyed the extent of the earth Tell Me if you know all this Where is the way to the home of light Do you know where darkness resides so you can lead it back to its border Do you know the paths to its home Surely you know for you were already born And the number of your days is great Have you entered the storehouses of snow or observed the storehouses of hail which I hold in reserve for times of trouble for the day of war and battle In which direction is the lightning dispersed or the east wind scattered over the earth Who cuts a channel for the flood or clears a path for the thunderbolt to bring rain on a barren land on a desert where no man lives to satisfy the parched wasteland and make it sprout with tender grass Does the rain have a father Who has begotten the drops of dew From whose womb does the ice emerge Who gives birth to the frost from heaven when the waters become hard as stone and the surface of the deep is frozen Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the belt of Orion Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear and her cubs Do you know the laws of the heavens Can you set their dominion over the earth Can you command the clouds so that a flood of water covers you Can you send the lightning bolts on their way Do they report to you Here we are Who has put wisdom in the heart or given understanding to the mind Who has the wisdom to count the clouds Or who can tilt the water jars of the heavens when the dust hardens into a mass and the clods of earth stick together Can you hunt the prey for a lioness or satisfy the hunger of young lions when they crouch in their dens and lie in wait in the thicket Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God as they wander about for lack of food Do you know when mountain goats give birth Have you watched the doe bear her fawn Can you count the months they are pregnant Do you know the time they give birth They crouch down and bring forth their young they deliver their newborn Their young ones thrive and grow up in the open field they leave and do not return Who set the wild donkey free Who released the swift donkey from the harness I made the wilderness his home and the salt flats his dwelling He scorns the tumult of the city and never hears the shouts of a driver He roams the mountains for pasture searching for any green thing Will the wild ox consent to serve you Will he stay by your manger at night Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness Will he plow the valleys behind you Can you rely on his great strength Will you leave your hard work to him Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully but cannot match the pinions and feathers of the stork For she leaves her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand She forgets that a foot may crush them or a wild animal may trample them She treats her young harshly as if not her own with no concern that her labor was in vain For God has deprived her of wisdom He has not endowed her with understanding Yet when she proudly spreads her wings she laughs at the horse and its rider Do you give strength to the horse or adorn his neck with a mane Do you make him leap like a locust striking terror with his proud snorting He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength he charges into battle He laughs at fear frightened of nothing he does not turn back from the sword A quiver rattles at his side along with a flashing spear and lance Trembling with excitement he devours the distance he cannot stand still when the ram’s horn sounds At the blast of the horn he snorts with fervor He catches the scent of battle from afar the shouts of captains and the cry of war Does the hawk take flight by your understanding and spread his wings toward the south Does the eagle soar at your command and make his nest on high He dwells on a cliff and lodges there his stronghold is on a rocky crag From there he spies out food his eyes see it from afar His young ones feast on blood and where the slain are there he is”
