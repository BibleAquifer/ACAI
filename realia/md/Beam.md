* HAB 2:14–18: “For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors pouring it from the wineskin until they are drunk in order to gaze at their nakedness You will be filled with shame instead of glory You too must drink and expose your uncircumcision The cup in the LORD’s right hand will come around to you and utter disgrace will cover your glory For your violence against Lebanon will overwhelm you and the destruction of animals will terrify you because of your bloodshed against men and your violence against the land the city and all their dwellers What use is an idol that a craftsman should carve it or an image a teacher of lies For its maker trusts in his own creation he makes idols that cannot speak”
