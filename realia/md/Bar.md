# Bar
**Bar**. 
Bars or poles made of acacia wood were passed through rings attached to the frames. The dimensions of these poles are not given, although Exodus 26:28 says that the center pole ran the entire length of the Tabernacle wall, that is, 30 cubits (15 meters; 50 feet) for the side walls and 10 cubits (5 meters; 16.5 feet) for the back wall (acai). 
Other forms include: 
*Pole*.
