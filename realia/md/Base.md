# Base
**Base**. 
The frames that made up the wall of the Tabernacle, as well as the posts that surrounded its court, stood in recessed metal bases, or mortises, which provided them with stability. The bases for the Tabernacle frames were made of silver, while those for the outer court were made of bronze (acai). 
Other forms include: 
*Mortise*, *Socket*, *Stand*.
