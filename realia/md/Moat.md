# Moat
**Moat**. 
The moat was a wide ditch or trench dug outside the walls of a city in order to make the wall a more difficult obstacle for those who would attempt to attack from the outside. A moat could be dry or filled with water, but in the conditions of the land of Israel a dry moat was more likely (acai).
